","A group of scientists build a rocket and fly to the Moon.Wonderfully imaginative and innovative. Directed by Georges Melies, a pioneer in the art and technology of film-making. Shot in 1902, when cinema was in its infancy, the movie shows cinema's theatrical roots, as well as the resourcefulness and ingenuity a pioneer like Melies possessed, and needed to possess. Clever set design, ""special effects"" and editing. Good plot with a great innocence and imagination to it all. It also gave us the iconic moon-with-a-rocket-in-its-face image.Such a landmark film in cinema history that it features heavily in Martin Scorsese's homage to cinema - 'Hugo' (2011)."

","Georges Méliès's 1902 masterpiece is not just a science fiction movie. It's also a satire on nineteenth-century science. It attempts to show the illogicality of logical thinking, as a great voyage gets achieved by incompetent doofuses, with the movie's most famous scene as the ultimate example.""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" (""A Trip to the Moon"") is also an indictment of colonialism. The astronauts attack the Moon Men - called Selenites - and then bring one back to Earth, where they parade him around. This clearly reflects France's occupation of large swaths of Africa and Asia. Indeed, the statue at the end is similar to an anti-Boulangist cartoon that Méliès earlier drew.The movie recently played a role in Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"", and the DVD that I watched included Scorsese in the Special Thanks section. It's a fine look at what humans once imagined the rest of the universe to be. This is truly one of the movies that you have to see before you die."

","""A Trip to the Moon"" is justly the most popular early film. I've seen thousands of early short movies and have commented on some of the most interesting cases, but this one is more amusing and imaginative than the rest (although a rather sinister reflection of colonialism may be read into the explorers treatment of the Moon's natives). It's better than Georges Méliès's other surviving pictures because it has a more developed story--without the tableau vivant style becoming as boring as it usually does. Wacky humor and trick shots help, but that's in the rest of his oeuvre, too. Influenced by the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, as well as Adolphe Dennery's adaptation of those pieces, the story is about a gang of astronomers, who, launched from a cannon onto the Moon, encounter explosive aliens (or ""Selenites"", as Méliès called them).Méliès used the stop-motion (or substitution-splice) effect and arising smoke for explosive characters in many of his films--same with superimpositions, animated miniatures and placing a fish tank in front of the camera. Additionally, his set designs were the best of the day. I easily forget it's all done within a cramped studio. He often used moving props, too, but this is one of the few that I've seen where the prop is pulled towards the camera--creating the famous rocket kissing the moon's eye gag. The following shot is a temporal replay of that action from a different perspective. It works here, but Edwin S. Porter would make the mistake of adopting the technique for ""Life of an American Fireman"", which was reedited later, leading many to believe it was a landmark in narrative editing. The ""30 tableaux"", as Méliès called it, is linked by dissolves--a common transition at the time, which he introduced.Méliès made it known that his goal was to push cinema towards resembling theatre. The benefit was longer films with more developed stories. Given this, it's ironic that he was one of the first filmmakers to achieve effects specific to motion pictures (i.e. incapable of being produced in theatre or other art forms)... i.e. the trick shots.Numerous early shorts are blatant imitations of Méliès's work, but they usually weren't as funny or creative. Many studios even duped his films and sold them as their own, which led to Méliès patenting his work in the U.S. and joining the Motion Pictures Patents Company (MPPC). ""A Trip to the Moon"" represents the height of his career. His work would soon diminish under the hectic schedule of the Nickelodeon age and the monopolization by the MPPC and Pathé, and he would end up burning his own negatives. Watch Jacques Meny's documentary ""La Magie Méliès"" (1997) for a good telling of his life and films.(Note: This is one of four films that I've commented on because they're landmarks of early narrative development in film history. The others are ""As Seen Through a Telescope"", ""The Great Train Robbery"" and ""Rescued by Rover"".)"

","Trip to the Moon, A (1902) **** (out of 4) aka Le Voyage dans la LuneGeorge Melies' landmark film tells the story of a group of men who want to explore the moon so they build a rocket and fly there only to discover some moon monsters. There's no question that this is one of the greatest landmarks in the history of cinema and the amusing story just shows the wonderful mind of the director. This really is a fairy tale about what the moon would be like and this moon creation is something we've seen in the director's previous films but this time out we get to explore the fairy tale. I think the greatest thing about this movie is its visual look, which really blows ones mind when you consider how well it holds up today. The look of the moon is brilliantly done as is the underground creatures that attack towards the end. There's also the landmark scene of the ship flying into the face of the moon and there's no question this is one of the greatest scenes in film history even if it was made over a hundred years ago."

","Since seeing nods to the landmark work in Martin Scorsese's Hugo,I've been meaning to see Georges Méliès A Trip to the Moon,but for some reason have never got round to it.After a wonderful day celebrating my dads birthday,I felt that it was the perfect time to go to the moon.The plot:Meeting up at the Astronomic Club, astronauts Barbenfouillis, Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas,Omega, Micromegas and Parafaragaramus decide to build a space ship in order to travel to the moon.Each play their part,they all build the spaceship and set off.Landing on the moon,the group starts making plans to leave their mark on it,but soon discover that the moon has other plans.View on the film:Showing the title to be much more than solely having the iconic shot of the moon ""getting it"" in the eye,writer/director and star Georges Méliès displays a creativity decades ahead of its time.Taking 3 months to shoot, Méliès makes every shot with a surrealist flourish leaping from spectacular in camera special effects moving the foundation of the Moon,to a tribe on the Moon showing who is in charge. Inspired by the work of Jules Verne & H.G. Wells,the screenplay by Georges Méliès blends the animated Sci-Fi thrills with a cleverly underlying satirical edge. Working as a anti-Boulangist satirical cartoonist before entering the movie world, Méliès takes a superb satirical shot at imperialism,as the inhibitions on the Moon rise up, and send the scientists on a trip to the earth."

","... lunar opthamologists must be so expensive! So why should you watch this film? Lumiere was one of the first of the filmmakers to try and entertain audiences with fantastic tales versus Edison's shots of reality. I also think Edison actually tried to steal this film from Lumiere, but I could be wrong about that.Lumiere does everything in long shots, there are no close ups. Individual performers and performances are not the point. It is the fantasy in its entirety that is the point. There are girls dressed as ushers that help the scientists, all decked out in long wigs and robes like judges as a head scientist draws their trip on the board. Their rocket ship is shot out of a cannon directly into the man in the moon's eye. The surface of the moon looks like it is overgrown with tree roots, and the scientists simply lie down and go to sleep until passing stars spot them and start a snow storm. They seek shelter in a cave where they realize that if they plant their umbrellas in the ground that they grow like mushrooms. Then they are captured by the natives who look like people dressed in skeleton Halloween costumes with spears. The scientists strike the natives on the head and realize that causes them to disintegrate. They use this to escape, get back to their rocket, and with one scientist hanging on the front of the rocket to get it to tip over the edge of the moon, they and their rocket fall back to earth, into the sea actually, with one of the moon natives hanging on to the back of the rocket. The rocket is towed back to land where there is a grand parade with the lone native shown off as an exhibition and prisoner.I'm telling you the entire story because there is not THAT much story, and the fun is in looking around at Lumiere's interesting and intricate sets. The laws of gravity were known, but past that I don't know how much science knew about space travel in theory, and how much Lumiere just ignored for the fun of it all. It's funny some things they accidentally got right. The capsule landed in the sea, just like American space capsules did. The hitting of the moon people over the head and them disintegrating seems like a forerunner of the zombie movies of later in the twentieth century. And Lumiere got that people liked to look at pretty girls, thus he has his film full of them, scantily clad for the time period, even when they don't seem to have much purpose. But then Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser was doing that on TV - having pretty girls escort CEOs to their chair like they could not find their way from one side of the stage to the other - until about 1990!"

","In twenty years, Georges Méliès has designed and made approximately 600 short films, before prematurely disappearing because of a precarious financial situation aggravated by a widowhood in 1913 and the First World War in 1914. His originals were mainly destroyed between 1914 and 1925, either to recover the silver in themselves or to transform them into heels of military shoes for the ""poilus"", i.e. French World War I infantrymen. Thus, those available today, on YouTube for instance, are mostly hand-colored copies.A century later, Georges Méliès is unanimously considered as a prolific and awesome pioneer. In France, he built the first film studio. He dedicated his life to silent film and illusions. This film is a masterpiece of illusions and poetry, thanks to many technical innovations, well before Avengers: Endgame (Anthony and Joe Russo, 2019). It is part of the French heritage, as Scrooge, or Marley's Ghost (Walter R. Booth, 1901) in UK, or The Great Train Robbery (Edwin S. Porter, 1903) in USA."

","The best remembered film of Georges Méliès, this film was such a success upon its early release that it was one of the first films to be bootlegged*. Based loosely on Jules Vernes' From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon.Professor Barbenfouillis and five brave astronomers - Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas and Parafaragaramus - have decided to go to the moon, gifting us with that iconic image of the rocket hitting the face of the lunar surface directly in the eye.The learned men that do make it to the moon have no issue crushing its natives, the insect Selenites, literally exploding them with just a casual push. After running wild through many of their number, the astronauts - who had been awakened by the gentle swinging of Phoebe goddess of the moon just hours earlier - escape back to Earth, enjoying a parade where they lead a captured alien through the streets as a banner unfurls with the legend labor omnia vincit (work conquers all).Film scholar Matthew Solomon has written that Méliès, who was previously an anti-Boulangist political cartoonist, used this adventure and science fiction film as a parable within which to decry imperialistic domination. His conquering heroes aren't really scientists and smart men, but dolts who hurt everyone they meet and still return to a hero's welcome.While there are black and white versions of this film, the one that played Fantastic Fest had the hand tinted colors that were created by Elisabeth Thuillier's lab, which would make up to sixty prints of certain films, giving them an otherworldly quality which is perfect for this essential piece of cinema.The version that played Fantastic Fest has the score interpreted by House of Waters, which features ""Jimi Hendrix of Hammered Dulcimer"" Max ZT, Moto Fukushim and Ignacio Rivas Bixio.*By Thomas Edison!"

Brief Review -Earliest Sci-Fi Phenomena in Cinema World. The first groundbreaking visual masterpiece of 20th Century. Sci-fi was explored in long length feature film during mid 20s but French cinema's magic man Georges Méliès was doing it even before 19th century ended. When i heard that this man was the only one at that time who created visual phenomenons like magical moments, disappearance tricks on screen, unseen worlds and fascinating atmosphere etc i became very anxious to see his work. Thanks to AFIs list of 1001 movies where A Trip To The Moon is the First film sorted in ascending year wise mode otherwise i would have never came across this miraculous product. While reviewing the film made in 1902 i don't need to talk about storyline, screenplay, acting and rest of filmmaking aspects and i am feeling very good about it. No need to use brain for the tactical understanding because just seeing just the Film made in 1902 is so freaking awesome feeling in itself, you know what i mean. The film is about a group of astronomers go on an expedition to the Moon. The visual statics of are so fascinating, first the cannon-capsule they travel in then the moon surface and the scenary around there. Then there are stunning graphics, iconic images like stars, angles, snowing around and what not. And above all the disappearance of ""Aliens"" was just unbelievable, i mean i couldn't believe my eyes that these visuals were achieved in 1902 and in such a gigantic manners, neat and clean like ice. The sublime storytelling is marvelous and not just fine for the time but highly influential for the future films made in the entire century. I am STUNNED, SHOCKED and BLESSED to have seen this astounding short and I request you to see it. This is where the concept of larger than life cinema was born.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest"

","Directed by pioneering magic man George Melies, A Trip to the Moon (1902), is a technical achievement by being the first. It shows us what was going through turn of the century minds as it applies to space travel and what the Moon looks like. What can you say about a film that started a whole genre and pretty much launched all film-making processes found today? Without Georges Melies' ""trick"" films, we may not have the advances in film-making that we have today. His excellent knowledge of framing and set design, influenced many after him. Not only is it a very old representation of film as it applies to film history, but it also is a great representation of history itself and what men in the early 20th century envisioned in our future.The most interesting part about this film is the fact that 12 years after the release of this film, Melies was chased out of his motion picture studio in France by the military during WWI and by 1938 was a penniless magazine stand clerk. Added with the uncanny accurate look into the future, such as the splashdown in the ocean of the capsule and the ships coming to rescue it, the film has a magic to it even for 1902 and yet the man who created it was as human as the rest of us. The film has many abstract ideas throughout, which really makes the viewer question about what Melies was thinking. What is the significance of the astrological symbols on a lot of the magician-like clothing? Why something as primitive as a giant gun for a launcher and a giant bullet for their vehicle is among such wonderful futuristic landscapes?8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB"

","A group of astronomers hold a meeting where they discuss how to travel to the Moon. The head astronomer proposes that they build something like a huge gun or cannon and fire themselves at the lunar face. After some argument, this is agreed upon, and we see the construction of the cannon and its bullet-like capsule. Once on the moon, the astronomers discover the strange civilization of the Selenites.A Trip to the Moon (aka Le Voyage dans la lune, Voyage to the Moon, and even A Trip to Mars, curiously enough) is usually considered the first token sci-fi film. ""Token"" is important there, as this surely isn't the first film we could call sci-fi--even Trip to the Moon director/writer/producer/star/production designer/etc. George Méliès' own The Astronomer's Dream, or The Man on the Moon (Le Rêve d'un astronome, 1898) predates this by four years. But this is the first widely known and accepted sci-fi film, with a significant length, and it has the important distinction of a pithy, well-told story, which Méliès based on Jules Verne's De la Terre à la Lune (From the Earth to the Moon), first published in 1865, and parts of H.G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon, first published in 1901. The fact that it was intended as something of a parody is often overlooked, and recontextualizes its sci-fi progenitor status quite a bit, but in a positive way. Like horror, sci-fi frequently walks a fine line between camp and seriousness, so it is appropriate for the token seminal film to have parodic elements.Far more important than A Trip to the Moon's relation to sci-fi, however, is its significance as a film, without genre qualification. Unlike most of the other early film pioneers, Méliès had a background in show business. He was a skilled magician/illusionist who took over a famed Paris venue, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin. Méliès embraced the theatricality of film, always searching for ways to make the new medium approximate the ideals (well, or at least the ideals of the fantasy and spectacle side) of the theater. Thus, he made rapid advances in production design, literary content, special effects and further developed an early form of editing, providing a bridge between the early shorts, which were purely mise-en-scène, to a more modern form of montage.A Trip to the Moon's scenes, with their elaborate production design, complete with backdrops painted by Méliès, are still constructed in a way similar to Thomas Edison's The Barbershop (1894), or the Lumière Brothers' Baignade en mer (1895)--that is, with complex, layered, contrapuntal motion playing out before a static camera, which represents the audience's point of view as they watch the action unfold on a ""stage"". The difference is that whereas Edison and Lumière tended to shoot for a feigned naturalism (in some cases--but far fewer than the conventional wisdom has it--actually capturing a ""natural"" event), Méliès tries to see how far he can push the fantastical. The result is a film that is as much an example of surrealism as anything else. If you have a taste for those genres--as well as for sci-fi, the absurd, and so on--as I do, and you are acclimated to silent films, you are sure to love A Trip to the Moon.The sets are amazing. The painted backdrops merge seamlessly with the constructed portions and props, creating locations with great ""depth"", in worlds that seem to surreal exist and have a long history. There are a number of ingenious techniques used to further the illusions, such as the smoke pouring out of the Parisian factories (probably a satirical depiction of some of the negative results of the Industrial Revolution) as the astronomers, who are initially amusingly dressed like wizards/alchemists in long flowing robes and large pointed hats, mount the building to begin their journey. Although some of the special effects and illusions are fairly transparent--such as the descending portions of scenery to enhance the effect of the ""Earthrise"", most are surprisingly sophisticated. Visually, Méliès is as impressive as even many modern instantiations of special effects, matte paintings and such. He certainly trumps much low-budget science fiction--even through the 1960s and 1970s--in this department, plus the surrealistic touches give him an edge that I would like to see more in modern films.Just as important, the story is very entertaining. The pacing and narrative construction sustains your interest and manages to make a short that is less than 15-minutes long seem as substantial as a 90-minute feature. Although I've seen versions in the past without it, I now have a version with the intended voice-over narration included (in Kino's ""The Movies Begin"" box set). This greatly enhances the film, especially as it is frequently but dryly funny.Much has been said, and maybe not just by Freudians, of the sexual subtexts of A Trip to the Moon. For example, the astronomers are assisted by Parisian showgirls, or ""manservants"", in sexy clothing (they now seem somewhat prescient of the costumed and uniformly choreographed showgirls to come in Hollywood musicals). They build a large gun to shoot themselves to the Moon, and they land with a ""spurt"" in the Moon's eye. Whether or not any of that was intended (although Freudians, at least, would say it doesn't matter if it was intended), there are more than enough comical and satirical takes on astronomers, space travel/the nature of space, and the ""reality"" of the Moon and its surprising inhabitants to keep anyone entertained. This is truly one of the earliest masterpieces of cinema."

The film itself is mainly of historical importance, but this historical importance is big.Georges Méliès was one of the founding fathers of early cinema. He pioneered in special effects and made a start with film editing. His roots were in vaudeville theater. This can be seen in ""Le voyage dans la lune"" when the launching of the rocket ship is festively accompanied by a couple of cheerleader like girls.Thanks to the initiatives of his countrymen the Pathé brothers film did outgrow the vaudeville format and got a theater of his own, called a cinema. Méliès fell into oblivion and got financial problems. Only due to a rediscovery in 1929 he could spend his last years carefree."

Written and directed by Méliès himself, ""Le Voyage Dans la Lune"" is a wonderful visual fantasy that shows Méliès' imagination at its wildest form, and how with limited resources and lots of creativity he managed to make a film like nothing the world had ever seen before.""A Trip to the Moon"" is loosely based on the books ""From the Earth to the Moon"" by Jules Verne, and ""The First Men in the Moon"" by H. G. Wells, as it deals with the adventures of a group of astronomers in their first travel to the moon and the wonders and dangers of their Odyssey. After arriving to the Moon in their bullet-shaped spaceship (it was launched by a giant cannon), they discover the Selenites, the people from the Moon; and as their presence is unwelcome, the group of astronomers will have to fight for their survival.With a runtime of barely 14 minutes, ""Le Voyage Dans la Lune"" is an awe-inspiring ride of fantasy, adventure and magic that more than 100 years after its release, still captures the imagination with its wonderfully crafted visuals and its charming comedy. The plot is very well-written, as the story flows nicely and although of a very simple nature, it's very well-developed and really entertaining showing that Méliès was a gifted storyteller.However, the most amazing feature of ""A Trip to the Moon"" is without a doubt its amazing visuals. With a mix of stage tricks, camera tricks, and several types of animation, Méliès crafts a surreal fantastic vision of the Moon with the care of a painter and great artistic sensibility. It's almost as if a painting came to life. The now iconic image of the Man in the Moon being hit in the eye by the spaceship is only one of the many amazing scenes that the genius of Méliès crafted with great imagination.Director D.W. Griffith said about Méliès, ""I owe him everything"" and Charles Chaplin called him ""the alchemist of light"" and both men were absolutely right in their remarks. Georges Méliès' work is a must-see for every film buff and I dare to say, for everyone in general as in its simplicity, it conveys humanity's most powerful trait: Imagination. ""Le Voyage Dans la Lune"", Méliès's most famous film, is without a doubt an immortal classic and one of the greatest films ever done. 10/10"

The movie has a great and intriguing imaginary story, of course based on the well known Jules Verne novel.Of course the events presented in this movie are heavily outdated. The astronomers can magically breath on the moon without any spacesuits and gravity also is not a problem. It becomes all the more hilarious when they decide to take a nap on the moon under a couple of blankets. A man can also fall from space Earth into the water and lives to tell the story. The moon is also filled with lots of giant mushrooms and strange hostile aliens and the moon and stars all have faces. Of course totally ridicules all but what did they know back then? Space traveling wasn't possible and astronomers knew very little about space and life in space. Even cars, radios, airplanes were yet had to be developed at the time for commercial use. But in essence the movie also has a core of truth in it, about the capsule being shot into space like a bullet. In that regard this movie is quite amazing and revolutionary about its ideas, though of course most credit for that have to go to Jules Verne. Director Georges Méliès makes the story work out believable and entertaining, with lots of early special effects and some overall great storytelling.The movie is only a couple of minutes short but that doesn't mean its not well developed. Lots of different stuff happens in the movie, from the building of the capsule, to the actual launch and landing on the moon and the astronomers mishaps with the hostile aliens and their king.Some of the early effects are amazing, obviously especially for 1902 standards but I perhaps liked the set decoration and costumes even more. It gives the movie a really great adventurous and imaginatively look and feel. It makes the movie very pleasant and entertaining to watch, even by todays standards.Definitely a revolutionary and important classic movie, in terms of its directing, story and special effects, that also is surprisingly entertaining to watch still.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I just saw ""The Great Train Robbery"" in its entirety for the first time and I was truly amazed. Its hard to believe that the film is over 100 years old. It was shot from a stationary camera but it employs many of the cinematic techniques that have since become commonplace such as cross-cutting, the chase, the shootout etc. VCI Entertainment has released a marvelous 100 Year Anniversary Edition of the film in two versions...a completely silent version from the print owned by the U.S. Library of Congress and a second version with added music, color tints and sound effects. Briefly, the story (filmed in the ""wilds"" of New Jersey), centers on four bandits who subdue a station agent (to keep him from sending out an alarm) and then climb aboard a train when it stops to take on water. Two of the bandits proceed to the mail car, kill the agent and make off with the loot. The others take care of the engineer and his fireman. One can imagine what the early audiences must have thought when one of the bandits suddenly throws the fireman off of the train. The cutting from the live action with the bandit and the fireman to the obvious dummy was quite innovative for the time. The bandits then line up the passengers and rob them killing one of them as he tries to escape. They then ride the engine down the tracks to their waiting horses. Meanwhile the town folk are alerted at a local hoedown and form a posse to go after the robbers. What follows is a great little chase scene and the final showdown between the good guys and the bad guys, where you know who get what's coming to them. The closing shot of actor George Barnes emptying his six shooter at the audience is perhaps one of the most famous shots in cinematic history. One can only imagine the effect that it must have had on the early audiences. I had always thought that this shot was at the beginning of the film. Early western pioneer ""Broncho"" Billy Anderson plays four roles in the film including one of the bandits. Most of the scenes are filmed in medium to long shots. You don't really see the actors faces (except for Barnes as noted). But it is still a very good film for this or any time. It tells a complete and believable story in about 12 minutes and sets the stage for the many classic silent films that were to follow. A truly historic cinematic experience."

","The Great Train Robbery was filmed only a couple of years into the 20th century, and when you watch it, its age is quite obvious. However, when you watch movies like this, you need to transport yourself back to the time period in which it was created and kind of watch the film through eyes that haven't been subjected to spectacularly visual films like The Matrix or Terminator 2. Edwin Porter made a ground-breaking film with The Great Train Robbery. Sure, the scenes were very simple and the film is so blurry that you can't make out a single face (this is also a result of the total lack of close-up shots), but in 1903 people watched this film and were stunned. It was hugely successful because it was one of the first films in the world to be made that actually told a story. Previously, films were made mainly to show off the technology of the ""moving picture,"" and the public loved them because they had never seen such a thing before. But when Porter came along with The Great Train Robbery, the path of motion pictures changed dramatically because people began to realize that these films could tell stories just as well as they could show water lapping on the beach or factory workers getting off of work or people jumping into a lake. These were the type of films that were made in the 1890s and early 1900s. The Great Train Robbery is an extremely short film, but it is an interesting story that is made even more fascinating because of the fact that everything that happens on the screen happened nearly 100 years ago. It's like looking at a piece of history."

","It's hard to assign ""The Great Train Robbery"" a rating, as it shouldn't really be watched as a film the way we watch films now. But from a historical perspective, it's fascinating, and is an excellent example of the use of film editing, an art form then in its infancy and now an award category recognized every year at the Oscars.Before this movie, it wasn't customary to tell multiple story lines simultaneously, but here, various activities going on in different locations are intercut to create suspense. D.W. Griffith would use this technique much more ambitiously (and combine it with many other developing film techniques) in ""The Birth of a Nation"" over ten years later, but credit must be given to ""Train Robbery"" for blazing a trail.Also, this is the movie famous for the shot of an outlaw shooting a gun directly at the camera.

The interesting scenes for me were the ones where the passengers are held at gunpoint while their valuables are collected, the shoot-out with its hand-coloured bursts of gunfire, and the famous final shot where a gun is fired directly at the audience.  Not too frightening now, but back in those days this was quite an innovation.Historically important and with a basic plot still in use today, this film holds significant interest for a wide audience (and will take less than a quarter of an hour of your time to view)."

","Arguably the first motion picture to employ the milieu of what would quickly become known as the Western genre, Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery was a smashing success with audiences (dozens of film history texts report with glee how viewers shrieked with fear and delight when a tightly-framed gunslinger pointed and fired directly at the camera) and made remarkable strides toward the establishment of longer, more narratively developed films.  Porter's cutting was also among the most sophisticated to date, as multiple locations and events were suffused with a previously unseen urgency.  Based on actual events, The Great Train Robbery ignited the imaginations of the scores who saw it -- making the movie one of the earliest examples of sensationalized, fictionalized screen adaptations taken from historical precedent."

","What can one say about an 11 minute film, which is reputed to be the first narrative motion picture to be shot in the United States? What does one compare it to when nothing had come before it? What is even more amazing is that parts of this movie are in color! The women's dresses at the dance are in color - each frame had been hand colored. The flashes from the barrels of the six shooters are red and an explosion sends up a riot of color. There is even a little girl in a red coat. Take that, Steven Spielberg!! Except for the last five seconds, all of the shots are in medium to long. The camera never moves. For each sequence, it is set in place and actors move in front of it.It is a western, of course (shot in the wilds of New Jersey). A gang of bad guys knock out a train station clerk then board a departing train. They move to the car where there is a safe, blow the safe, stop the train and rob the passengers. Back in town, the clerk revives and tries to get help but passes out again. A little girl comes in wakes him up. The townspeople are having a dance when the clerk runs in to form a posse. The posse rides out and surrounds the gang, who is counting the loot in the woods. There is a gunfight and the robbers are killed. That is the whole story, but there is one short scene left - one of the most remarkable in film history. The all color episode lasts about 5 seconds. In medium close-up, a cowboy raises his pistol, points it directly at the camera, and fires three times. It is difficult for us to understand why this is here or what purpose it served. But when people who had never seen a movie before and didn't have any understanding of the technology first saw this man shooting at them, they screamed, fell to the floor, and ran for the door. It is also said that some in the audience pulled firearms and shot back. It is an early testament to the power that motion pictures had, even in its earliest incarnation. Thankfully, TCM ran TGTR without any modern musical accompaniment, as thousands must have seen it in the nineteen-aughts. I watched in total amazement. I was transported. Later, I reflected on how far movies had come and how little they had changed in the last 100 years. This movie is a priceless historical artifact that shows us just how much the past is still with us."
32,7-tt0000439,The Great Train Robbery,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000439/," Narrative Development: Structure
","""The Great Train Robbery"" was the most successful film to date, and its distribution preceded and eventually coincided with the spread of Nickelodeons across America. It didn't instantly create the Western genre; instead, it was part of and led to a spew of crime pictures--a genre begun in England. (G.M. ""Billy Bronco"" Anderson, who was somewhat of an assistant director on the film, would largely invent the movie Western a few years later after leaving the Edison Company, however.) Although the plot isn't very exciting today, the film remains a landmark in film history--mostly for its narrative structure. It's also notable how matter-of-fact, ""realistic"" and violent the film is for its time--being detailed and rather objective in its following of the details of the crime (what Neil Harris calls ""an operational aesthetic""). The story film was already established by 1903 but was still in its infancy. Filmmakers were still experimenting with how to tell a narrative, and Porter was one of early film's greatest innovators, as well as an astute student of film.Throughout his film-making career, Porter was strongly influenced by contemporary British and French films, which he would have ready access to since the Edison Company regularly duped them. His ""Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show"" is a rip-off of Robert Paul's ""The Countryman and the Cinematograph."" ""The Gay Shoe Clerk"" is a revision of George Smith's ""As Seen Through a Telescope."" Porter also introduced intertitles to American cinema in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" having seen them in some of Smith's films. ""Life of an American Fireman"" reflects James Williamson's ""Fire!"" The temporal replay in that film was influenced by Georges Méliès's temporal replay of the Moon landing in ""Le Voyage dans la lune."" ""Dream of a Rarebit Fiend"" also owes plenty to Méliès.""The Great Train Robbery"" followed a recently created genre of crime and chase films begun in England. ""The Daring Daylight Robbery"" was especially of influence, as was, it is said by historians, a 1903 film called ""The Robbery of the Mail Coach."" ""The Great Train Robbery"" is also based on a play of the same title by Scott Marble. News of real train robberies also served as inspiration according to the Edison catalogue. Anyhow, with the exception of wholesale rip-offs, it's not discourageable that Porter learned from other films and adopted techniques and style from them for his own. He is worthy of history's praise for being such an avid student of film and one of the more active filmmakers of his time to develop film grammar.Some film historians and critics say that Porter's work was uneven, that ""The Grain Train Robbery"" and perhaps one or two other films were a happenstance success, or fluke. Someone was bound to figure out the techniques of narrative as story films became more complex--confronting such problems as spatially separate actions and the continuity of action. I've seen a good share of Porter's work, however, and it's apparent that he was usually experimenting. He wasn't consistent like Méliès, which is good because his work becomes stale. Porter's previous experiments in editing resulted in this, his most accomplished story film and greatest success.There are a few special effects in ""The Great Train Robbery,"" as others have mentioned. It's nothing new: double-exposure matte work for the shot of the train outside the window and for the outside of the moving train's door, hand coloring, in addition to stopping the camera and splicing to replace an actor with what is obviously a mannequin. Most amazing about this picture (for its time) are its structure and the editing and camera techniques employed for its continuity. Panning and tilting wasn't new, but this movement of the camera in one scene to follow the action is exceptional for 1903. Likewise, Porter and others had already used the close-up. Porter employed an insert of a fire alarm in ""Life of an American Fireman"" and a privileged camera position for ""The Gay Shoe Clerk."" The shock value of the close-up in this film even serves form as its entirety is supposed to thrill.Furthermore, the view from on top of the train is quite good. The transitioning between interior and exterior shots is fluent, and generally so is the continuation of action from scene to scene, with action exiting and entering scenes from appropriate directions. This is elementary film-making now, but in 1903, they were inventing it.What I think is the most interesting part of ""The Great Train Robbery,"" though, is its editing between the plot of the telegrapher and that of the robbers after their initial confrontation. After following the robbers for a while, the film cuts back to the ""meanwhile"" plot of the telegrapher. Initially, the barn dance scene doesn't appear to serve any narrative function--until the telegrapher enters to gather a posse. It's an interesting ordering of and transitioning between parallel actions. The plot isn't in temporal order, and it's a nice testament to Porter's innovation that a few modern viewers have been perplexed by how the posse catches up with the robbers so quickly.It would take D.W. Griffith and others to build upon past work and their own in moving towards more entertaining and cinematic films, but the developments in narrative experimented with by pioneers like Porter paved the way.(Note: This is one of four films that I've commented on because they're landmarks of early narrative development in film history. The others are ""As Seen Through a Telescope,"" ""Le Voyage dans la lune"" and ""Rescued by Rover."")"

","I enjoy this film even though it is very old and compared to today's cinema, very limited in its attempt at realism. But today's cinema would not be what it is without the original innovation of cinematic devices by Edwin S. Porter, one of films first masters. His progress in narrative construction and his work in special effects techniques astonished audiences like never before. His work was limited specifically because he used the static camera affecting the impact of each of his shots. His unique and influential editing style allowed the audience to take part in the action of the film, not sitting idly watching it. The movie is 12 minutes long and is considered the first narrative film in history. The most exciting scene is when the gangsters raid the train station and rob the train. The train is a really well done mat-shot of a train pulling into the station, frightening the audience in their seats. I personally am most excited by the final closing scene of the gangster shooting his gun, aiming it directly at the audience. This audience point of view shot makes me feel like the narrative of the train robbery enticed me to cheer for the Sheriff, and the angry gangster shoots at me because I was cheering for his enemy. This film and this sequence of the gangster shooting the audience was solidified in cinematic history when Martin Scorsese pays homage in 'Goodfellas', with Joe Pesci gun barrage and sinister look."

","THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY is one of the first ""modern"" movies because there is a definite plot as well as scenery, a coherent story and suspense. While this is also true of the even better French film, Le Voyage dans la lune that was shot a year earlier (1902), other than that, ""movies"" were almost exclusively plot less (they just turned on the camera and recorded mundane activities), or had no beginning, middle AND end--they were just snippets of action. At a whopping ten plus minutes, this movie was significantly longer than the average film as well (which often lasted less than one minute).On the plus side, it was and is still pretty watchable, with decent indoor sets and outdoor scenes, lots of action and some inventive camera-work. On the negative side, some of the action scenes were really, really lame--even for 1903! For instance, when the two men are fighting on the train, it's very obvious that the man is switched with a dummy and the dummy is tossed over the side--it really could have been done a lot better.

","...Because people with low blood sugar make bad decisions. It's what they do. First the robbers go in guns drawn but faces NOT covered, to deal with the depot office boy. He does seem bored at their presence. But then they hit him over the head and tie him with the world's skinniest rope. It seems like they are getting a train schedule from him and don't seem worried he can identify them. At this point the clock on the depot wall reads fifteen minutes until noon. That's why I say the robbers should have eaten lunch first. The clock reads the same time when the employee is found after the robbery. I doubt he lay there for exactly 24 hours.Then the robbers board the train. This time, when they deal with the man in the baggage compartment, the robbers do have their faces covered. This baggage fellow must be the same one in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, because he locks up the money - it's not HIS money - and shoots it out with the robbers and is killed. And what is it with that open door on the compartment? If money just fell off the train he could have been fired! But instead he has been fired at and has died.Next the robbers take control of the locomotive and stop the train. I see the point of this, as you don't want to jump off of a moving train. But then they rob the passengers. There seem to be about 100 passengers and only four robbers. Now really. This is the old west or at least the old pseudo west. Is it worth it to pick up whatever change is in the passengers' pockets when you already have bags of money to chance such odds? Especially in the days when both men and women often carried concealed guns and might take a shot at you?But the robbers take off unharmed to horses they left nearby. Someone fetches the Union Army - who I guess have had nothing to do since the end of the Civil War but participate in square dances such as the one shown - and the pursuit is on. Either they have the Lone Ranger to look on the ground and say which way the horses went, or the Union Army gets extremely lucky and catches up with the bandits. I'm sure the local sheriff was upset to be left out of this posse. And such has been the tug of war between local and federal government ever since.Now I realize I am doing this early film an injustice by poking fun of it so, but the real fun is in the watching of this early attempt at film narrative. Up to this point films were actualities - either actual events such as a fire or the tearing down of a building, or reenactments of short historical events such as the beheading of Mary Queen of Scots. This was made by the Edison company, which ironically lost out in the competition of filmmakers as movies became longer and more sophisticated."

","Despite it's humble and simple origins, this eleven minute silent film is wonderful for it's attempt at telling a story using the Western genre as it's format. The version I saw on Turner Classics contained a number of surprising elements that I wasn't expecting from a picture made in 1903. The first of these was the complete silence of the picture, no musical accompaniment of any kind, making this an unusual, one of a kind experience. Then, when the outlaws in the story blew up the strongbox in the train's mail car, a bright flash of orange and yellow lit up the screen making me wonder how the effect was achieved. Other viewers here comment on the process so I'll defer to those who know better.The use of color is done sparingly but to wonderful effect, and when I first saw the young girl in red attempting to wake up the injured mail clerk, the first thing I thought of was Little Red Riding Hood. The process is used again on the dresses of the dancing women and during the posse chase when gunshots are highlighted in a colorful powder flash similar to the earlier strongbox explosion. The very last frames of the cowboy shooting directly at the viewer was done in color as well, a neat touch to bring the brief story to a conclusion.The story itself was a forerunner to all those thousands of B Westerns that were soon to follow in the Thirties and Forties with endless horse chases and gunfights to excite movie goers of all ages. As expected, the bandits get their due in the film as they are all done in by the dance hall posse that quickly assembled to chase down the bad guys. The other main highlight of the picture had to be the crowd of train passengers who were forced off the train at gunpoint during the robbery.Oh, I shouldn't forget this item of note, it was kind of interesting. When the robbers made their way on the train, one of the engine crew came out to fight off an outlaw, and in the tussle that followed, he was beaten up by the bad guy.

","The Great Train Robbery is one of the landmark films in the development of narrative cinema. It tells the story of a group of bandits who climb aboard a train and rob it; they make their escape and are then chased by law enforcers and end up in a shoot-out. Up until this film, cinema was mainly at best a means of depicting visual trickery. What this movie did that was revolutionary was to tell a relatively complex story involving a number of different locations. Of course, from a modern perspective it is as simple as can be, but in the early years of the medium it just wasn't immediately obvious how to use this new technology to tell a story. It took a while for early audiences to understand what techniques such as cross-cutting actually meant. This film was extremely important in putting together some of the early basic cinematic story-telling devices in a way audiences could comprehend. And not only that, it introduced, via its story of a group of bandits robbing a train, some of the key ingredients that would go on to form an indelible part of genre cinema. The film ends on a scene that was more in keeping with the more gimmicky films of the time, when we are confronted with an actor who fires his gun directly at the camera, or at the audience. I imagine this would've caused a bit of consternation among some of the earlier cinema-goers.

45,20-tt0000439,The Great Train Robbery,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000439/," 10 Minutes that Changed the Face of Cinema ...
","In 1895, ""The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"", one of the early Lumiere films, left an indelible impact on the minds of the first movie goers who wondered what was this 'Cinematograph' thing all about. Although it's very unlikely that they screamed or ran away from the screen, there's no doubt that the sight of a train pulled by a steam locomotive, coming at full-speed, much more in their direction, must have been quite an unforgettable experience. And yet, that was only the beginning and I wonder what were people's reactions, eight years later, when a menacing-looking outlaw fired point blank towards the camera. Did they have the reflex to duck? Did they scream? Or did they realize they were the privileged witnesses of the genesis of Cinema as the most defining art of the Twentieth Century? I'm naturally referring to the last iconic shot of ""The Great Train Robbery"", if not the first Western movie ever made, the one that gained the first spot in historical posterity and would have certainly sunk into oblivion if it weren't for this last-second masterstroke. Like the title says, the film reconstructs the robbery of a train through a meticulous editing made of heart-pounding crosscutting and many creative uses of colors. In ten minutes, the bandits force a railroad telegraph to stop the train at a water tank, they kill a messenger, open a box of valuables with dynamite, disconnect the locomotive, pull the passengers off the train, steal them, kill one who tries to escape, then escape in the locomotive and stop at a valley when they get their horses back. Finally, the telegraph's daughter awakens him, a posse is formed and the villains are killed after a bloody gunfight. It's only a film of ten minutes but these ten minutes shook the world of Cinema like the '10 days that shook the world' during the Bolshevik Revolution. Well, in other words, ""The Great Train Robbery"" is pure Celluloid revolution. Indeed, the level of perfectionism involved in the recreation of the train robbery, with the maximum historical accuracy isn't much saying since 1903 wasn't that far from the real-life Western era, and watching the film is like turning yellowed dusty pages of a historical book. To give you an idea, even the Wild Bunch or John McCabe could have watched the film. But there is something so remarkably modern in its visual effects and so technically impeccable in its approach to action, to the recreation of the perfect widescreen shorts, the right angles, to every single movements from the protagonists, that it clearly shows the director Edwin S. Porter was a former cameraman from Edison Studios, he had an 'eye for action', and demonstrated that a director was more than a man to shout ""Action"" but one to direct it like a dancer with a choreography.And beyond the technical experiments, Porter understood the importance of leaving a final impact on viewers and the fact that the last shot of Justus D. Barnes shooting at the audience doesn't hold any connection with the previous scenes, and can only be interpreted as a free artistic license, shows that ""The Great train Robbery"" wasn't just thought a sort of documentary-like recreation, or an action movie but also as a piece of art, which by the standards of that era, can be easily labeled as a masterpiece, it's fresh, modern and so  bad-ass. ""The Great Train Robbery"" sealed the fate of Cinema as one of the most major forms of popular entertainments. The few the film features planted the seeds of all the great realizations to come.Indeed, you have them all in ""Robbery"": ""The Birth of a Nation"" for the suspenseful crosscutting, hence leading us to Hitchcock. In content, the film is the ancestor of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" or as a matter of fact, any caper or heist movie relating a criminal plot methodically constructed like ""Bob le Flambeur"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"". And naturally, you have Joe Pesci shooting at the end of ""Goodfellas"", or the gun barrel sequence in any James Bond movies, even a bit of ""Schindler's List"" is present through the iconic little girl in red. By the way, if Porter was the first to taint some aspects of the film such as the explosions or women's dress, I wonder if he tried to imply a dichotomy between lust and violence, well isn't that the whole purpose of movie-making summarized in the ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" axiom? See, all the cinematic ways lead to ""Robbery"".Of course, not everyone would be overwhelmed by the film, or share the same reaction than its contemporary viewers. Some might even laugh at the sight of people reaching their arms and twirling around when they're shot, but this is so futile compared to the film's contribution to Cinema. Every movie owes something to ""The Great Train Robbery"" if only the fact that the film established the superiority of Cinema as an art form meant to entertain people, to tell a story with an suspenseful set-up, a thrilling action and a powerful ending. Even ""The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"" had the same basic ingredients a static shot working as a set-up, a surprising twist and the climactic moment where the train reaches lower edge of the screen, but it was not fiction, therefore creation.And the content of ""The Great Train Robbery"" is filmmaking in microcosm, focusing on its core, which is action, translated in Greek by the word 'drama'. See, you have the core of film- making concentrated on this simple film and to judge ""The Great Train Robbery"" is to comprehend its historical and artistic importance, immortalized by the iconic 'shot' of Barnes shooting at us, the new visage of Cinema."

For sure i waited the moment when those bandits would be caught because i couldn't imagine a Doberman movie at this time! Moral is safe! The final shot of this bandit shooting the audience at close range is fantastic because it embodies truly what is cinema: a virtual reality filling you with emotions ranging from all the spectre, good to bad!

At last, with this movie, i finally reach my destination also because i have now watched 1 movie by year between cinema birth and mine!

","Great Train Robbery, The (1903) **** (out of 4) Landmark American film from Edison director Edwin S. Porter changed the way movies were made. The film tells the story of two bandits who pull off a daring train robbery and then try to reach freedom. I guess some might look at this film today and not see what the big deal was but in 1903 this film became a big hit because no one had ever seen anything like it before. Most films took place during one shot but this one here featured twenty-one different shots and changed the way stories could be told in movies. The action scenes are great, the color sequences are amusing and it's amazing to see how simply told this film is considering it was the first of its type. The final shot with the gunfighter firing his gun at the screen can still give you the chills."

","Here is the famous film so beloved of film freaks and homaged by directors.The earliest work in narrative is also one of the most dazzling early works. It's violent, high-paced, and colorful. Yet what makes it really worth the the bother to find is its creativity, at least at the time.So far, all the narrative techniques had not yet been developed, such as close-ups and the like. This film had to tell a whole story using what little experience it had, so it does it well. Firstly, double-exposures helped replace the standard wide-shot and also were used as special effects. Secondly, most of the action is contained to relatively small environments, so the filmmakers used a lot of depth in the frame to widen it and make it seem more real. Thirdly, color was used.It's also the film that has the famous image of the cowboy shooting at the screen, even if that image is largely useless by today's need for narrative arch.It was meant to dazzle, not to make sense. The fact that it can still dazzle today is what helps people understand its quality.--PolarisDiB"

","After films like ""A Trip to the Moon"", it was discovered that the new artistic medium of film could tell stories. By the time ""The Great Train Robbery"" was released, cinema was changed forever.The final shot has always been considered one of the most memorable shots in cinema history. In it, a cowboy is looking straight into the camera, holding a gun. Then, all of a sudden, he shoots right at the screen and the film ends. It's fun to note that this shot was payed tribute to in the acclaimed crime film ""Goodfellas"".""The Great Train Robbery"" is, without a doubt, one of the earliest crime films and one of the first films with a regular narrative.For 1903, it is really thrilling and well made.

50,0-tt0004972,The Birth of a Nation,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004972/," The Conventional Wisdom is Partially Right
","The conventional wisdom about ""The Birth of a Nation"" is that it represents an impressive and innovative display of cinematic skill that was unfortunately wasted on a story that promotes a bizarre and disturbing point of view. While that is certainly true in a general way, it might also be something of an oversimplification.It really is almost like two different movies. The first part, which takes place in the era before and during the Civil War, contains little objectionable material, and it deserves praise both technically and for the acting. The second part, set in the reconstruction era, contains almost all of the disturbing material, and it also is really not all that great in terms of cinematic quality.Then also, the degree to which ""The Birth of a Nation"" may have influenced the development of cinema has very likely been overstated . The controversy that it generated may very well have helped it to remain better known than other films of the era that were equally innovative and/or lavish, or nearly so.If the movie had ended shortly after the memorable and well-crafted Ford's Theater scene, the anti-war sentiment and similar themes would remain the main focus, since the effects of war on families and individuals is depicted convincingly and thoughtfully. In that case, its occasional lapses would possibly at the worst be called ""dated"", given the quality of the rest of this part of the movie.The second half, though, is completely unfortunate in almost every respect. Not only does it promote a distorted viewpoint, but the story becomes labored, and the characters lose their depth and become more one-dimensional. The purely technical side, such as the photography and the use of cross-cutting, might still be good, but much of the rest of it loses its effectiveness.Perhaps more importantly, it really seems rather difficult to justify the credit that this one film gets in the development of cinema. There had already been numerous feature-length movies, and most of the techniques that Griffith used were also in use by others. He may well have been ahead of the pack in terms of appreciating their possibilities, but that does not mean that cinema would not have developed as it did without this particular movie.Just as one example, the Italian epic ""Cabiria"", from the previous year, has the same kind of lavish scale, is quite resourceful in its techniques, and is quite entertaining, without causing so much controversy.Other early feature-length films also include some creative efforts to adapt film-making techniques to longer running times and more complex stories. Finally, many short features from the pre-Griffith era experimented with the same kinds of techniques that he later would use systematically. There's no denying Griffith's considerable technical skill, but others of the era also deserve some credit, even if they and their works were less controversial, and are now largely forgotten as a result."
51,1-tt0004972,The Birth of a Nation,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004972/," The Birth of an Art
","Before ""The Birth of a Nation,"" motion pictures were a medium with the potential to be an art. This movie, more than any afore, realized that promise. It's the most important film ever made; it's the birth of an art. Alas, it's also racist.The film's controversy appears to have left director D.W. Griffith dumbfounded, judging by Griffith's responses to critics and from descriptions by Griffith biographers. The son of a Confederate soldier, his prepossession for an antebellum South wasn't, if not still, unusual. Histories of the day, including those by would-be US President Woodrow Wilson, supported his perverted depiction of the Ku Klux Klan saving a South pillaged by carpetbaggers, scalawags and encouraged Negroes. The film quotes Wilson's ""History of the American People."" Thomas Dixon Jr. himself solicited the White House screening where the President is said to have quipped, ""It is like writing history with lightening, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true."" Dixon's racist book trilogy and the subsequent play were Griffith's inspiration for ""The Birth of a Nation.""In it, the American Civil War and Reconstruction disrupt the once-friendly relations between the Unionist Stonemans and the Confederate Camerons. The first part is largely free of controversy, although its racially-segregated imagery underlies a nostalgia for the institution of slavery; it's idyllic romanticism and melodrama typical of Griffith, absent Dixon. And, the battle scenes are excellent. Explosions, smoke and hundreds of extras fill the action. Future prominent directors like Raoul Walsh and Erich von Stroheim assisted the direction. The action shifts between bird's-eye views and medium shots, demonstrating vast scope with attention to isolated skirmishes. Including Griffith with ""Judith of Bethulia,"" filmmakers had until now failed to realize massive battles with such grandeur. To top it off, cinematographer G.W. ""Billy"" Bitzer's moving camera shot of the Little Colonel's charge.The second half of the film, when Congressman Austin Stoneman (based on Radical Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens) and his mulatto protégé Silas Lynch lead the freed slaves into postwar power, is when the racism becomes especially blatant. Blacks are portrayed as childish morons or as easily-excitable brutes--harmless enough if put in their place, such as with the condescending ""faithful souls."" According to Griffith, it's the mulattos that are especially dangerous, because they posses the cunning of a white with the animalism of a black. What they want is to ""marry,"" which means rape, white virginal women. The film is sexist, too. This is most evident in the infamous scene of the Black buck Gus chasing the childlike Mae Marsh through the woods, to a cliff she leaps from to preserve her purity. It's especially offensive because it's so well done, except for the trope of the ""Little Sister"" ludicrously surviving the fall briefly for a last gasp. The photography sets it apart, and the crosscutting intensifies the classic last-minute rescue attempt, as the Little Colonel enters the action.Yet, the Klan rescue is by far the most offensive and concurrently most exciting sequence in the picture. Griffith and his editors, headed by James and Rose Smith, crosscut between multiple actions, climaxing with the rescue of Elsie Stoneman from the threat of being raped, the Aryans and faithful souls under siege and the whole of Piedmont under the heel of a black mob. To that date, it's the most advanced, amazing montage and remains impressive to this day. Before, Griffith had found how exciting well-edited suspense could be, with ""The Battle at Elderbush Gulch"" and his last-minute rescue flicks, such as ""The Girl and Her Trust."" And a variation of Wagner's ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" greatly adds to the intensity.The silhouette of Klansmen riding upon a hill, with the sunrise behind; the moving-camera shot of the approach; the angled camera positions: Bitzer and Griffith photograph it brilliantly, too. That is, besides the interiors. Theatricality is the film's major cinematic weakness. This is most evident in the missing walls. The narrative structure is also traditional. Griffith would never do otherwise, and it's certainly not unique for 1915. Filmmakers were beginning to exploit the advantages of controlled filming within studio sets by now, but the open-air sets with natural lighting, as used here, were still prevalent. At least, the sets here are decorated in detail. Bitzer and Griffith, however, were consistently innovative in their beautiful outdoor photography--with camera movement and positioning, tinting, nighttime photography and good use of split-screens and of masking the camera lens.The acting is also theatrical, but Griffith did direct his actors to be subtler in comparison to contemporary acting. Lillian Gish rose to the forefront of this style, largely because of this film, which made her a star. She plays Elsie Stoneman, who has the more prominent of the two romantic relationships in the film with a soldier from the other side; she's Griffith's ideal white virgin. There are some especially well-acted moments here for its time. The sequence with Marsh using ermine in attempt to garment her ragged house dress for the homecoming of her brother and Henry Walthall's slow, moving walk towards the front door of home are especially poignant--showing the destitution of the postbellum South.""The Birth of a Nation"" is a troublingly racist picture, which is said to have revived the KKK (as well as being the cause célèbre of the newfound NAACP in its efforts to censor it). Nevertheless, its importance in film history, and its cinematic merits are immense. There are other impressive works from this time: films by Bauer, Chaplin, Christensen, DeMille, Sjöström, Starewicz, Tourneur and Weber. Yet, to say the least about ""The Birth of a Nation,"" as far as I've seen, nothing before matches its scale with such filmic innovation.It runs for 12 reels--having cost some $110,000 to make. Its vast popularity also had incalculable effects on movies as an industry, including the establishment of Hollywood at its center. Although other estimates are lower, Griffith-biographer Richard Schickel claims it grossed more than $60 million by 1917. Its influence, not only on cinema, is enormous. No other film has been as important to the direction of motion pictures as an industry and an art."

","First, I want to point out that just about every nation on Earth has struggled with racism and this review is not intended to slam the USA. Second, though this film was one of the very earliest full-length films and it has absolutely amazing battle scenes and production values, you cannot admire them and turn a blind eye to the rest of the film.I just read an idiotic review on IMDb that indicated they liked the film and it was essentially true! Huh?! I am an American History teacher and I can assure you this ""true"" movie is complete hogwash and a horrible testimony to our country at the time that this WAS widely regarded as truth.Here's the problem--nearly all the black roles are played by white people in black makeup. And, when the South loses the war, these ""uppidy black folk"" then run amok trying to rape the white women, subvert the rule of law and spend most of the time eating watermelons and dancing to banjo music (I kid you not--this REALLY is in the film). So, according to D. W. Griffith's view of the Reconstruction Era is that the blacks took control of the legislatures and went mad with power until the honorable KKK came to the rescue!!! The most awful scene involves sweet and innocent Southern belle being repeatedly approached for sex by a black man. He will not take ""no"" for an answer and eventually she jumps to her death rather than to be defiled by a Negro! My heart cringes just writing this!So, my overall verdict is this is a horrid film with wonderful production values. Also, and this may sound stupid I know, I recommend you DO watch this film! First, because how can you know about how far we have come as a people without knowing our past. Second, the idea that repellent images and movies should somehow be censored is repugnant--burying your head in the politically correct sand is just silly. But, for the love of God, DON'T TAKE THIS TO BE FACTUAL! If you do, I feel very sorry for you. And if you know someone who takes this for truth, set them straight.FYI--When this movie debuted, the KKK was practically dead in America. Thanks, at least in part, the KKK soon became one of the strongest political forces in the country--all the way through the 1920s. This is sad but true."
53,3-tt0004972,The Birth of a Nation,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004972/," Is the historical importance of this film greatly exaggerated?
","I saw this film at a small ""Art House"" theatre when I was a graduate student. It was supported by program notes, and reviews of the film by respected critics, these stressed Griffith was a trend setting director who had made significant contributions to modern cinema. I remember three major developments were attributed directly to him, firstly his use of a mobile camera for tracking rather than bringing events to the camera; secondly pioneering the use of close-up photography in the cinema and thirdly the incorporation of pseudo-documentary sequences (e.g. the assassination of Lincoln) into a fictional story. I therefore watched this film with great anticipation; but as something of a young idealist I was more and more sickened by what I then felt was glorification of the KKK, and afterwards I was bitterly disappointed by my evening. I decided that if I ever watched TBOAN again it would only be when I was better informed both about American history of the period and about the work of other contemporary Hollywood film-makers. It is now 60 years later and I see ""The Birth of A Nation"" is scheduled to be screened on TCM next month, so probably the time has come to watch it again; and perhaps comments based on my original viewing so long ago may be appropriate at this time as the impressions I now have of this film will be those that have been with me for most of my life.Films showing conflicts must present both sides as believing utterly in the righteousness of their cause; but historical films also have at least a moral responsibility to ensure the material shown has some reasonable approximation to historical accuracy, and whenever possible the convictions of both sides should be equally fairly presented. Most of the criticisms of TBOAN on this database derive not from its sympathetic presentation of the KKK but from the fact that this is presented as the only side which is relevant. We need to remember that slavery was introduced into human society back in prehistoric times - it was usually associated with a recognised obligation on the part of the slave-owner to provide a reasonable standard of living for his slaves, and alternative mediaeval societies from which slavery had been eliminated often did not do even this for their dispossessed citizens. Members of ruling classes everywhere lived a lifestyle which required the full time labours of many slaves or underprivileged workers to maintain, and only after the invention of the steam engine did it become possible to picture a world from which slavery might eventually be eliminated. Although this then probably became inevitable, its elimination has still not been completed; and in the United States it took place in an appallingly destructive way, part of which is pictured in TBOAN. Every nation has shameful episodes in its history which have and will cause distress for many generations before they are gradually outgrown. Recognising that the American Civil War did not result only from a dispute about slavery but much more from a whole range of economic and cultural issues, I appreciate that it would be grossly improper for me as a Canadian to seize on some of the controversial aspects of TBOAN as an excuse to condemn the film. I will re-watch it as a valid and important effort to document the concerns of the group of citizens it featured (although I will still reserve the right to feel Griffith should have made more effort to also document the concerns of those with opposing viewpoints.) My concerns here are directed more to assessing the importance of TBOAN in the development of the modern cinema, and I currently find myself siding with the relatively few users who have commented that its significance seems to be greatly overrated. When I first saw this film I had seen relatively few of the important early silent films, and it was easy to accept claims that Griffith's work was of overwhelming importance. Now I have seen other contemporary works; and have also come to appreciate that all surviving copies of about 90% of these works have totally disappeared (whilst probably half of the 10% of which copies still exist are not available for home viewing even from specialist libraries as the only copies are located in inaccessible archive collections). This is not brought out clearly by most of the 200 user comments on this film listed by IMDb, and it is so important that it has led me to pen these further comments. Film-makers in the silent era were extremely productive - Griffith himself is credited by IMDb with having directed over 500 films, most of them silent, and several other directors/producers have well over 100 films credited. Since so few survive, we must recognise how far our current assessment of early directors might change if we were able to see and compare more of their works. I believe that many innovations in film technology have been exclusively attributed to Griffith primarily because of the ready availability today of copies of 'TBOAN', 'Intolerance' and 'Orphans of the Storm'. I found this feeling very strongly reinforced when I had a rare chance to see a screening of Lois Weber's 'Hypocrites'. Weber was, for a time, the highest paid director in Hollywood and received a best director award in 1916 (ahead of Griffith, just one year after he released TBOAN). All I will say at this point is that, although I am admittedly relying on rather uncertain memories, I believe 'Hypocrites' was more stimulating for its innovative cinematographic techniques than 'Intolerance'. It would be interesting to know whether other database users have had similar thoughts about this or other early works."

","Anyone who thinks that this film depicts real history is seriously deluded. One commenter noted that the KKK was fighting for a good cause during Reconstruction, but not now.  I guess to him good causes include killing and intimidating freed slaves who were merely attempting to exercise their rights to vote and make a living.Griffith's portrayal of Reconstruction black politicians is not only racist, but blatantly untrue.  Only in rare instances and for a short time did black representatives control any Southern legislatures, and this at a time when they were the majority of voters in many Southern states!  For years teachers of Reconstruction have emphasized carpetbaggers, but have ommitted the fact that the post-Reconstruction governments were founded with the explicit purpose of disenfranchising blacks and violently enforcing their underclass status.  For this reason and others, Birth of a Nation's claims to historical accuracy would be comical, if not for the horrific implications of the film.That said, this film should be seen, mainly because it provides a document of a poisonous way of thinking that is by no means dead.  It also represents the pop cultural moment when Northern and Southern whites reconciled over the memory of the Civil War, mainly to the detriment of blacks.  Lastly, those who want this film burned only give ammunition to the idiots who still praise the KKK.  It's better to let these jerks hang themselves with their own rhetorical ropes than to let them claim victim status."
55,5-tt0004972,The Birth of a Nation,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004972/," Great techniques and a horrible message...
","...yet I still give it an 8/10 for all of the ground that it broke. When it was released in 1915, the Hollywood movie industry was still in its infancy as movie makers such as DeMille had only been there about a year or so. Most movies were made on the East coast and used artificial lighting which often gave the films a very flat look.Most filmmakers would film outside until the late afternoon and then close up shop. Griffith however liked to use lighting just as the sun was going down as it gave everything a soft glow. These scenes looked better than anything you could have achieved in a set with artificial lighting in those days. The battles scenes also looked very good, like a lot of care was taken to set them up and make them as realistic as possible. This kind of an epic was rare for the times and must have surprised most movie goes who were more used to short films that were often shot on sets with artificial lighting. Some of the innovations of BOAN (it should be noted that while Griffith didn't originate all of the techniques used in BOAN, he was the first to integrate them all so seamlessly in a feature-length film) included night-time photography-Billy Bitzer achieved by firing magnesium flares into the night for the split-screen sequence of the sacking of Atlanta, being the first film to have an original score, the first film to employ hundreds of extras for the battle scenes, flashbacks and parallel editing, and extensive use of close-ups, long shots, dissolves, etc. to heighten the impact of the story.It's not fair to other films and filmmakers to say this film and this film alone changed movie history but it's definitely on the short list of films that did along with DeMille's ""Squaw Man"" released the previous year which is remembered as Hollywood's first feature length film, even though it is not. That honor goes to Helen Gardner's ""Cleopatra"" made in 1912.Then there are the features of the story that give this film a well-deserved bad rap for having revived the KKK. ' There is the Austin Stoneman character who is biracial and wants to rule the South with an iron fist. He sets himself up as some kind of alternate President during reconstruction. Where was the real president, Andrew Johnson? Locked in a broom closet? This character was supposed to be a thinly veiled caricature of Thaddeus Stevens. Since white Confederates have their civil rights suspended during this time, the state houses of the south are shown packed with the absolutely worst stereotypes of black men, with them eating, drinking liquor, and taking their shoes off and putting their feet on their desks during the chaotic legislative sessions. They are also shown as sex-mad for Caucasian females, the biracial Austin Stoneman included. Let's just say that the story is as subtle as a sledge hammer, but when you realize that its contemporaries considered a guy in a cape with a long mustache tying virgins to railroad tracks to be high drama, the actual message of BOAN may be hogwash, but the complexity of the story telling and the sophistication of the acting is to be admired. That's why I recommend it in spite of the point of view of the script. Sorry for the long review, but a long film often requires one."

Not only is it an accurate portrait of the propaganda being written in the 1870s, but it is a primary source document on how people in the 1870s and 1910s saw African Americans.

","A lot of people see this film as an artistic triumph. But the fact that it's well made doesn't redeem the underlying message. You can say that it was a different time... make excuses for it... But there are some films that are best viewed as a regrettable part of American history.This film is quite simply a justification for the genocide and subjugation of African Americans and a recruitment video for the KKK. It warps history and attempts to manipulate the audience into believing offensive racial stereotypes to justify white supremacy. It romanticizes plantation slavery in the south, when in fact it was a time of suffering for many. Most of the black characters in this movie are just white men in black-face, portraying extremely offensive racial stereotypes. It ignores the fact that many white individuals did not live this lifestyle, and lived in poverty during this time (another HUGE cause of the Civil War which is virtually ignored today)and instead tries to rally whites to it's cause by referring to it as an ideal time.The class I watched this with ALL thought it was ridiculous and completely offensive, regardless of race and gender. Granted... in 1915, it was a different time and a different culture. They viewed this film as a piece of art. But we're in 2009. Racial relations have changed. There is still an undeniable racial divide, but it is nowhere near the levels found before the first World War. It's time we stopped making excuses for films like this. This is nothing more than well made KKK Propaganda presented under the guise of history. I give it the 1 it truly deserves as a film that still exists in our society. However, I will give it this... Despite it's problems, it is important to watch this film from an academic standpoint: the ONLY reason being to understand our artistic history and the mistakes made. It should be viewed as a marker for how far we've come, and how far we still need to go to achieve true equality."

","I've read a few of the 10's at this site and am a little surprised at the pass given to this monument to slavery, racist bigotry, and violence. ""Birth of a Nation"" is a national cinematic embarrassment. That it is well crafted is moot. If this were a movie that glorified rape or child sexual abuse, but was well crafted, well directed, and had outstanding performances in it, would we be discussing it's virtues as a fine piece of film making? I don't think so. Consider this: Nazi Germany committed mass murder against Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Slavs, and political enemies. The plunder and suffering inflicted against these people ripples through our culture to this day. The fact that Leni Riefenstahl's cinematography in ""Triumph of the Will"" was ""groundbreaking"" is kind of beside the point!!! I find the intellectual airy fairy commentary in the 10's section of the reviews here to be disturbing. Frankly, I think you people should be ashamed of yourselves for promoting this disgraceful homage to slavery and murder. Slavery is at the very least murder of the soul. But we all know that was the least of it's offenses. ""The Birth of a Nation"" is a bad film because it promotes a reprehensible ideology. The merits of it's production values are irrelevant. And not that it should make a difference but for the record, I am a white male southerner."

","D.W. Griffith's Civil War shorts were only a prelude to what has become one of the world's crowning cinematic achievements and one of its most painfully embarrassing moments concurrently.To this day it still causes not only controversy but even verbal warfare amongst friends and critics.  But if films were judged solely on their subject matter many of our classics would have been tossed into the garbage hamper.  As being such, I will not let that taint my opinion of it.""Birth of a Nation"" succeeds on so many levels its difficult to find a place to start.  Perhaps its best to say that Griffith may have considered what he may be starting hence the freedom of speech title screen at the beginning. For not shying away from controversy alone Griffith deserves his merits. His use of tinting is outstanding.  Some may say (and they may be right) that Griffith is the father of the modern screenplay.  His use of setup, turning point, confrontation, turning point, resolution, and conclusion is still the formula used today and is usually the formula that has graced every best picture winner at the Oscars ever since their 1927 beginnings. The catch:  there was no written screenplay.  Griffith made this film in his mind as he went along.  THAT is genius.The battle spectacle scenes were unequaled in their day.  This wasn't another day's work.  This was a big budget, Hollywood, parade of the extras, grand scale masterpiece.  One gets the sense that the real war was just getting the war scenes filmed.  Father of the close-up, father of the chase scene (on two fronts: individual after individual and group after group), father of showing synchronous events on two different stages, the buildup of dramatic climax, and the list goes on.  Outstanding use of camera angles (the perch overlooking the valley during Sherman's march comes to mind here), and historically accurate enactments (Lincoln's assassination) score big as well.  This was ""Citizen Kane"" a quarter of a century before there was a ""Citizen Kane.""The acting is surprisingly very well done.  Henry Walthall does a fine job as the star of the film but George Siegmann, Walter Long, and Ralph Lewis are three of the most villainous characters to ever grace a silent era film. And I would be amiss to not mention Lilian Gish who absolutely sizzles here.  After all these years she is still one of the most charming and beautiful women I've ever seen in my life.  Griffith obviously thought so as he used her in his other three masterpieces as well.But for all of its cinematic showcasing, the film's image will forever be scarred by its outlandish racial prejudices.  And make no mistake about it, its a difficult watch.  As a white, its still difficult for me.  As a black, I cannot imagine.  It is so easy for me to sit here and say to separate its art from its viewpoint but that simply isn't realistic.  Should it be required viewing?  Yes.  Would I blame any black for not wanting to watch it or hating it after seeing it?  Absolutely not.  I understand where you are coming from.  The unfortunate thing is that the film could have succeeded without this viewpoint by simply making the south's new oppressors white union soldiers.  It IS historically accurate  to say that president Andrew Johnson did indeed want to crush the southern elite into oblivion after the war which is one of the things that led to his impeachment.  But Johnson, who is strangely not even mentioned in the film following Lincoln's assassination, certainly would not have employed northern blacks to do the crushing.  I understand the film was following Thomas Dixon's novel and play but to not even address how Ralph Lewis' senatorial powers overshadowed Johnson's presidential ones and those of Congress' 1866 Civil Rights Bill is proof enough that the film goes out of its way to make northern blacks the villains.  Griffith's only defense, and it is a SMALL defense, is that southern blacks are still apparently our friends.  Griffith was the son of a Confederate fighter which may explain some of his views.  But certainly he did not want to be a hate-monger.  He tried to apologize with the making of his next film, the masterpiece ""Intolerance.""  He certainly had black friends on the set during the making of ""Birth of a Nation"" but this harks of the classic case of the good man who doesn't realize that some of the things he is saying are hurtful.  I don't think it really dawned on him. This however is a trivial compensation at best.But at the end of the day, D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"" is still a landmark achievement not just in film but in popular culture.  After its release film became a way of life for America instead of a treat you helped yourself to once in a while.  Not until Hitchcock would a director ever again be the star of his own films, wielding a control and vision so unique that their name is forever welded to our memory, for the better or the worse.  So many firsts.  So much controversy.  And controversy,ironically enough, has been Hollywood's middle name now for the last 50 years.The nutshell:  absolute required viewing for all things considered.  Watch with caution and prepare to be disturbed.  Not being able to watch it is easily understood.  One of the 100 greatest films of all time...10/10."

","This movie had the stockholders quaking when they saw the costs mount. It was the most expensive movie made up to that time, and it shows that silent films really COULD create spectacle on a grand scale.One of the posters remarked on how ridiculous the Klansmen's hoods looked. Actually, the original ""ghost costumes"" were all homemade and there was no standardized uniform- some had spikes on the head, horns, painted faces on the masks, etc. I myself had an ancestor who was a member of the Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan, and they saw themselves as guerilla fighters against an occupying power, not as terrorists. Today we can condemn them. At the time, it must have seemed to them that the war was over, but that the battle lines were still firmly drawn.This film is a good peek into the attitude of the general public in 1915 about Reconstruction. It became a national obsession, and probably gave impetus to Col. William Joseph Simmons's decision to ""resurrect"" the Klan in that year."

I wonder if any of our modern films will be able to evoke such passionate response 90 years from now and the fact is, I think not. Yes, the film is racist. Yes, the film is a watershed for cinema. And no matter what you think of it, it's still got people stirred up, ready to scream and yell and be appalled, disgusted, outraged, etc. Can there be any doubt as to its greatness if it still has such a life today? Its greatness certainly doesn't lie in its subject matter, but in the fact that this silent film can provoke such reactions in a generation weaned on computer graphic images, a generation that views the silents much as they view watching a parade of fossils drift by. I am literally stunned by the power of a piece of film to move so many so long after it came into the world. Perhaps its greatest lesson is the impact films have on us and our society and how powerful those moving images can really be.

","I have watched this film several times over the years, and I find the second half dealing with reconstruction a little harder to watch each time. Although its racist viewpoint may have mirrored much of America in 1915, it obviously was not the only viewpoint, since America had its abolitionists in the early 1800s.  Griffith endorses just about every wretched stereotype put forth by the south during and after reconstruction, namely the venality of all northerners and the baseness of all blacks who did not completely bow to whites.  A good example is that the disdainful depiction of the black-run state legislature is based on a cartoon, not an actual photograph or contemporary description.  Griffith's portrayal of northerners and blacks is completely from the point of view of a white southern racist.  Although I greatly admire much of his work, he deserved the criticism he got for this film.  Aside from the political racism, much of the second half of the film is just silly melodrama, even based on 1915 standards and other Griffith work."

","Saw 'The Birth of a Nation' for quite a few reasons. One was that it was directed by DW Griffith, the more that has been seen of his recently he and his work became more interesting. He made a lot of very good to classic films, short and feature. Lillian Gish was one of the greatest silent film actresses, who never failed to move me, and there was a reason as to why she was a Griffith regular. Also wanted to see what caused so much controversy and still does was as bad as all that.After seeing it, 'The Birth of a Nation' is pretty difficult to rate and review with me being so conflicted on it. While appreciating that 'The Birth of Nation' was/is ground-breaking and that it is of historical importance, the second part really ruins the promise that the first half showed so it was very difficult for me to get much out of it. It is very easy to see why the film is so controversial and why it is considered offensive. While it is one of Griffith's most historically interesting films, it is also his most divisive by far and one of his worst in my view.'The Birth of a Nation' still looks great, Griffith's films always were extremely well made technically, some of the camera shots innovative and unlike what was seen before at the time. Gish is typically wonderful, the poignancy brought to her relatable role being quite powerful. The rest of the cast are also on fine form, especially Mae Marsh and Robert Harron.Griffith's direction is masterful and technically more than efficient, well certainly in the first part and keeps the second from being unwatchable (along with the acting). The first part of 'The Birth of a Nation' is absolutely brilliant, very compelling and epic as well as moving.Which is why it is so regrettable that the second part feels like a different film and difficult to sit through. It is with the rescue and from that point on that 'The Birth of a Nation' falls downhill badly, despite the production values and acting still being so top notch. It is not just one-sided, but it is also blatantly racially offensive now and even for the time, which has always been the biggest criticism directed towards the film. It takes a lot for me to be offended by a film but even when judging it for the time and accepting that racism is far from gone today, that didn't stop me from feeling uncomfortable with the portrayals of the supporting characters in the second part (African Americans portrayed negatively and a notorious group in history treated as heroes). It may be based on objectionable source material, but this was a rare example of a film that would have been much better straying away from it and not true to it.All that being said, that is sadly not all with 'The Birth of a Nation's' criticisms with the second part. Its pacing is very pedestrian and from the rescue onwards the story is badly over-stretched even for a film intended to be epic. What started off so rivetingly became a test for endurance where the eventually excessive length was felt. The characters completely lose their dimension and go from complex to one-dimensional stereotypes and the melodrama gets very over the top and downright silly.Overall, brilliant first part but the second is a mess. 5/10"

","This film was and will always be controversial, as the American Civil War is today. It is difficult to have a neutral analysis of the conflict and the period of reconstruction that followed, and I am not going to be the one who has not even studied US history to make this analysis. Nor did I read Thomas Dixon's ""The Clansman"" to find out if the film is fair in its adaptation to the screen and if the book shares the political and social vision that the film expresses. The film is divided into two parts. The first, quite consensual, follows the Civil War until Lincoln's death. The second part follows the following years and the first movements of the Ku Klux Klan.Of course, the film is partial and is not politically correct ... expresses an opinion about the conflict and the years that followed, claiming that there were political mistakes and that too much power was given to blacks, that in a sense freedom was confused with permissiveness and that values, mentality and pride of the southern white class were little taken into account by Union policies. The birth of the Ku Klux Klan, in turn, is portrayed as a consequence, a reaction of a slice of southern white society that felt threatened by new order of things. This is what the film supports, I don't know if it was so.In the film's script, two families portray the divided country: on the one hand the Stonemans, with a strong political influence in Washington, and on the other the Cameron, who own a plantation in South Carolina. The families have a friendly relationship, and these ties they are not broken by war. Proof of this is mutual assistance on the battlefield. Another interesting detail is to see how Lincoln, despite being the leader of the winning faction, was portrayed as someone very respected by southerners. Each family suffers losses and dangers during the conflict but it is still at war that Ben Cameron falls in love with Elsie Stoneman. In the second part of the film, Ben is an increasingly dark and worried man, and he is the one who founds the KKK to protect those he sees exposed to the abuses of the newly freed blacks. Some scenes are strong, like the attempted rape of Ben Cameron's younger sister, which ends in the worst way and is easily one of the most dramatic moments in the film. In a way, the little girl was the portrait of innocence in this film, and dies almost like a martyr.Technically, the film is extraordinary. Whether you like the story told or not, it was a milestone in cinema with several important technical advances for art. The battles of the war are reconstructed with great realism. The cinematography and filming were particularly brilliant, as well as the historical reconstruction, done with great realism and rigor both in the costumes and the sets. Hundreds of costumes dressed up were part of this filming, which must have been an effort and marked the beginning of cinema as an entertainment industry. The music that accompanies the entire film is marked by diverse leitmotives, which were extracted from the nationalist and confederate national anthems, as well as from several well-known melodies of classical music."

","The Birth of a Nation has pretty much established itself as perhaps the most frustrating movie ever made. I won't cover what has already been said--that this is a landmark film of astounding genius that is sadly wrecked by its racist pro-KKK ideology. I agree with the assessment and find the experience of the film very jarring.I would rather focus on what might be useful to a potential viewer of this movie. The real question regarding this movie is whether, as a viewer, it is possible to separate out these two aspects and still have a useful experience from the film. I think the answer really varies from viewer to viewer. On the plus side, there is no question that there is some amazing genius at work here--the photography, cinematic techniques, acting, and scope were all revolutionary and very influential, the viewing of the movie is well-paced and in fact riveting. You will be fascinated for sure.Can this fact be separated out when it becomes clear that the main protagonists of the movie are the KKK? That's the real question. In this sense, the movie becomes more instructive than entertaining. We learn a number of things--first, some important aspects of the history of technical filmmaking, which Birth of a Nation pioneered. Second, that movies always project a world-view, which can be significantly different from yours as a viewer, althuogh I think it is reasonable to point out that many people still sadly hold on to the world-view of this movie. Third, that movies will try to persuade you toward that world-view; in that sense, Birth of a Nation is a dangerous movie and had some truly bad consequences (it helped the revival of the KKK). Fourth, that the lens to the repugnant world view can actually be beneficial, a gateway to perceiving and understanding the past.Thus, I cannot really tell you whether you personally will enjoy this movie. If you are a white supremacist, no problem. If not, you will have to compartmentalize for sure."

","This is a film which every movie buff really does need to see, for two reasons.  1)  It shows how far the movie making process has come, and gives us all a way to truly appreciate some of the other early films, and how far the moviemaking technology advanced between 1915 and the 1930's.  and 2) It also allows us the chance to appreciate just how conflicted our society has always been, not just today.  Many of the other reviewers have labeled this film as racist garbage, but it truly does represent one group's view of society at the time, and gives us a great way to understand some of the driving factors behind the race relations problems we would have later. In particular, during the Civil Rights battles that would take place during the 1950's and 60's in the deep South.The film is the story of two families, one Northern and one Southern, and how their lives would be intertwined during and after the Civil War.  It focuses on two sons who fought in the war, and the effects their fighting would have on their families, mostly focusing on how one son would go on to be the founder of what we now know as the Klu Klux Klan.  What I found most interesting is that a group we now speak of in such evil tones are represented in the movie as the defenders of all that is good and holy. When put in it's historical context and we realize that President Woodrow Wilson talked about the movie in such high praise, it gives us a real appreciation for how the world we live in has changed.In particular, though, pay attention to the battle scene in the movie. What seems to us to be extremely simple special effects, were the highest technology available at the day, and viewed by the public as an incredible work of storytelling.  When taken in context, you can only be impressed by Griffith's storytelling abilities, no matter what you thought of the story.While the movie is no great work by today's standards, and I actually found it very hard to watch considering it's simple style as compared to today's movies, I think this is a movie you definitely must see.  It gives one a real appreciation for how far movie-making technology has advanced, and makes us realize just how much different our society is now than we were just one century ago."

","I can completely understand your frustration with this movie. It's no secret that it's a racist film and did result in the revival of the KKK. But you have to understand what life was like back then. In 1915, nobody had ever seen a movie like this. Not just in terms of production, but in terms of editing, length, casting and attention to detail. It was the first time in history where a ton of effort was ever put into a motion picture. When ""The Birth of a Nation"" came out, people began to take film much more seriously and wanted to see more high quality movies when it was brand new. As for the racism, it was sadly a product of its time, but that's not to say people didn't find it offensive in 1915. Plenty of African Americans were outraged over this movie and tried to have it banned. The KKK would even use this film as a recruitment tool up until the 1970's, although this wasn't the intention of its director D. W. Griffith. He probably had no idea that people would be outraged over this movie, but I don't think he intentionally tried to offend a lot of people, he just wanted to make a movie that people would remember and hoped to impress as well as shock. He did just that, Birth of a Nation is certainly impressive and shocking. It is offensive by today's standards and obviously a movie you could not make today. But I do believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression and I don't believe in censorship. This film should be shown in all film classes so we can not only understand how the first big budget film was made, but to understand what racism was like in 1915. I am strongly against banning this movie because it's essentially the same as pretending the racial prejudices never existed, but the views expressed in this movie does not represent me as a person. I only appreciate the art and attention to detail that was put into this movie. It is nothing short of groundbreaking and way ahead of its time regardless of it being the most politically incorrect movie in history. You should definitely watch the movie as long as you are prepared to be shocked and see film history."

","The title of this review says it all. The reason people call this film racist is because it has a very realistic idea of how racism was at the time of the Civil War. And Griffith wasn't racist either; he wanted only to show how white people thought of blacks at the time. So anyone who hates this film is only hating on how black people were treated at the time of the War. That's silly to hate on; that time depicted here is gone and today black people are treated equal.This film is three hours long, much longer than a full-length movie would be today (I was shocked when I heard this films' run time). It is all about two families (the Stonemans on the North side, and the Camerons on the South) experiencing the Civil War and its aftermath. The slaves, once they are freed, begin to rise up against the white men, which is when the KKK steps in, to stop the continual rise of the freed slaves. True, they are depicted as heroes here, but again, that's how it was then: perhaps the Klan was, at the time, considered heroic. Of course, it's different today, as the entire outlook of the society has changed. But you certainly can't attack this film for what it did: it tries to show history and racism as it used to be, and presenting the scenario of the black people becoming superior is very interesting.I thought this film captured the essence of the War well. The acting was very good, and it actually looks like it was made during the War, which was, of course, impossible. This film combines fact as well as fiction. Of course the story itself wasn't the work of Griffith or anyone else involved in this film: the story was based on a book called ""The Clansman"", by Thomas Dixon Jr. I have not read the book but it looks like it was well adapted. True, some of this film is slow-paced (for instance, the beginning introduces the characters and takes quite a bit of time to do so) but when the film gets exciting, it turns into a cliff-hanger at times. It is presented in 2 parts: the first part deals with the historical events of the War, and the second part is a fictional story involving the KKK and a crazy idiot named Silas Lynch. Both parts are well done, and the person who played Abraham Lincoln (Joseph Henabery) was fit for his role. The Lincoln Assassination was also well done too, with plenty of suspense and excitement.Hands down, this is a brilliant, intense, exciting masterpiece. One of Griffith's best, alongside ""Intolerance"" (1916)."

","I don't know what prompted Griffith to make this film. Ignorance abounded. The South was reeling from the post Civil War era. The book, the Klansman, was probably pretty popular, just like anti Muslim books became popular after 9/11. This in no way should make such content acceptable. As we look at historical curiosities, this film falls into that category. I bought a VHS copy of this a few years ago because I had never actually seen it (I had watched isolated clips on cinema retrospectives). My wife and I were stunned by the content, although we knew what it was about. To see it, makes it even worse. Nevertheless, since I've been educating myself about film history and craft over many years, I felt I really needed to watch it with both a critical and a societal eye. One thing I saw was masterful images of war on film made in 1915. I saw motion and shadows and all the other things the early geniuses did to separate themselves from the also rans. The editing is excellent. The acting is emotive and appropriate for the time period. I have seen other Griffith films and know that this was a mistake. He could have applied his genius to another milieu, but he didn't. I doubt that anyone takes the content of this film seriously. If it weren't so sad, it would be downright amusing. The stereotypes are so lame and over the top. But we need to place ourselves in the historical context and evaluate it that way. Mostly, however, we need to look at it as one piece in the process of the development of cinema."

Both have the capacity of creative technical and even emotion genius, while at the same time, a penchant for prejudice and bigotry. What makes their work so difficult to judge is that it tends to slip in and out of sickness subtlely and surprisingly.  Their genius has the power to draw one into its fold, then manipulate one's emotions to its pleasure. Having gotten the viewer hooked into its context, it weaves its clever, overpowering spell of persuasion.Their is very little to uplift the spirits here, to make one feel good about one's self, not to mention one's fellow beings.  Where is the love and celebration of life as it's to be lived?  Where is the joy of this precious gift to be on this planet, enjoying its richess?  Where is the embracing of each and every human being who is our brother and sister, and trying to empower them to reach their full potential?I see none of that here, only a lugubrious attitude of hatred, superiority, and downright fear.  Parallels between the work of Leni Riefenstahl and her ""Triumph of the Will"" and ""Birth of a Nation"" are not without validity.
This work will forever be a contridiction, and there is no hope in making it better.  We can only strive to separate its technical achievements from its low-level mentality -- or avoid the work altogether."

","""Birth of a Nation"" is a disturbing paradox : it is one of the most important movie ever made, but also an absurd demonstration, from both a historical and artistic point of view.The movie is divided in two parts. The first one introduces two American families, who share love and friendship, before the civil war tears them apart and transforms the bound between the two families in epic battles full of blood and tears, where the two friends of yesterday are now leather enemies and have to kill and die in each other arms. To those bloody war images, Griffith wants to oppose an universal peace message, and that's how he introduces art in cinema : the cinematographic images are now for the very first time able to support and carry an universal message. Cinema is now considered as an art, with the equal pretensions that literature could have, as the opening citations of the ""Bible"" or Shakespeare's shows it.In 1915, Griffith is the all Cinema and his art has no rival. In this first part, the support of Griffith for the south reinforces the humanistic aspects of the movie : we are on the losing side, which goes with the romantic tone of the movie. And above all, the other characters are treated with the same compassion and respect than the south. For it's indeed the southern families who lost the more in the civil war (I mean in the in the movie...), as one of the most moving and sensitive frame of the early cinema underlines it : the Cameron's son, the only survivor of a family of three children, comes back in the family mansion in rags, where his coquette sister is awaiting for him. She lost all here precious beautiful clothes for the war effort and is now miserably dressed. He hesitates on the front door,the brother and the sister are afraid to look at each other, she shyly shows him her dress with a sad smile and they finally kiss each other. The artistic and sublime conception of Griffith cinema succeed in those poetic and melancholic images.However, the second part absolutely and definitely ruins all this artistic efforts. And it's the same elements which lead the movie from the grandiose to the stupid. Griffith, indeed, has a very American point of view on art, which has to be ""bigger than life"". That's why the movie can't end with the melancholic defeat of the south, but as to show its re-rising. And this ""second chance"" will be the doomed the movie to the worth stupidity and racism.That's because of this narrative reasons that the movie sacrifices the universality of its message for a a racist and historically absurd vision of the past. Griffith interprets Lincold's death like the starting point of a kind of ""black regime"", that the North tries to establish in the South, in order to create chaos and anarchy (?!!). This ridiculous theory is shown like a historical fact in the movie, and legitimates racist and stupid images, which contrasted with the humanist message of Griffith. We can for instance see the deputy's room of South Carolina controlled by alcoholic and sexually depraved colored men, actually eating chicken wigs ! In order to fight this imaginary ""black insurrection"", the Cameron's son, don't have any choice : he creates a group of white knights to fight it, the Ku Klux Klan. And the worth of it is that this group is in the movie the real heroes of the American union.Even the right to lynch black people is given to the KKK by the stupidity narrative point of view of the movie. There're always in Griffith' a naive woman, who represents purity, and who dies from a tragic death. In BOAN, it's the little Cameron daughter, who committed suicide to save her honor, after a black asked her to marry him (certainly a metaphor of a rape). The black man is killed by the KKK, who ""only reestablish justice"".It is strange to see that somehow, the racism of the movie doesn't have any impact of some judgments on this film. Sadoul writes for instance in his ""Histoiry of Cinema"" that ""Even when the racism of the movie chocks the spectator, he's even more shocked by the beauty of the images and the absolute perfection of their editing."" Pierre Leprohon also thinks that what's Griffith may think doesn't really matter, the only fact that Griffith sees the cinema ""as something which can carry his thoughts"" is important. And I can't disagree more. Of course, I don't deny the importance of the movie in cinema history, but the fact is, that because of its racism, it doesn't archive to be what it's meant to be : a universal and humanist movie, and a piece of art. It's not a moral point of view on the film, but a artistic one : BOAN ISN'T A GOOD MOVIE. Where a sublime effect must arise in the spectator's soul, only indignation stays. No, the ""beauty"" of the movie doesn't erases its stupidity and its incoherence but only makes his pretensions more absurd. And that's why what's some see as one of the most important movie in film history is also, and mainly, a bad movie. Fortunaly, one year later, an absolute masterpiece would actualize everything BOAN failed to do and really give birth to cinema as an art. This movie will be done by the very same Griffith and he will call it ""Intolerance""."

Chaotic, unpredictable, upside down, with endless sneaky tricks that defy our conception of 'movie' magic because they mainly involve Cirque-type human machines doing things that couldn't have been faked so convincingly at this date. I mean, you can see the splice whenever a character turns on the light, so when the bitchy criminal mastermind Irma Vep gets wrapped up in rope, then rolls down the side of a four-story building like a human yo-yo, you know you're watching history in the making. What's more, and redemptively, the stupid detectives are REALLY stupid, including this outrageous Italian stereotype who keeps nyuk-ing straight into the camera. There's a wild chase-fight scene on a moving train, a gas attack on a large high-society do, a kid accidentally shooting his father in the nose, and God knows what else. This dumbfoundingly imaginative, yet consistently goofy and crowd-pleasing movie could only have happened in a medium whose limits had not yet been properly defined - in fact you can see the definition happening on screen.

","What an incredible piece of history and cinema this is. ""Les Vampires"" is an 10 episodes long French serial, by Louis Feuillade. A sort of early 20th century mini-series, you may call it. I can't imaging how incredibly gripped the audience must have been while watching one of the episodes in the theater and couldn't hardly wait for the next chapter of the story.Of course these sort of chapter-plays weren't really anything new at the time of 1915 but still ""Les Vampires"" is one of the best and most unique as well as accessible of its kind. It has a greatly written and intriguing story, that shows the dark side of common men and the criminal and more disturbing, less peaceful and dangerous side of beautiful Paris.The serial tells the story of an organized criminal organization, known as 'Les Vampires'. A sort of more rebellious than criminal, organization, who blackmail, kill and steal from the high society in Paris. The episodes follow this organization as well as the groups who battle them; a rivaling criminal organization, the police and a journalist and his friend, who are the real main characters of the movie.Perhaps the entire serial can also be seen as a social commentary on the life of the rich in Paris but I can't be completely sure of this were the creators intentions.The first four episodes are perhaps a bit of a drag, since it mostly focuses on development of the characters and the events. After that the gloves are off and the serial turns into a very exciting and tense serial, in which lots is happening, both action- and story-wise. The first few episodes also differ widely in its running time and some are around 15 minutes long, while other are around 30 or 45 minutes. The later episodes are all around an hour long.The serial features lots of daring escapes, traitorous characters and criminal plans to cause mayhem in the everyday society. Yes, at times the serial gets overlong, since it often repeat itself. Basically the serial is about the characters constantly chasing and capturing each other, until they escape again and things seem to start all over again. It probably is also the reason why you shouldn't watch all the episodes just as once. Best is to watch around 2 episodes a day, to keep the tension and intriguing aspects of the story and characters to a maximum level.The story telling is surprising good, for 1915 standards. The entire production is a silent one and it forces it to tell the story entirely by its visuals and acting. It does this well and makes the story understandable, although it gets a bit too hard to follow at certain points. Because it has to explain and tell everything with its visual, some of the sequences are overlong. The acting is of course also exaggerated at times, to put down a certain emotion or tension in the story but not as much as some of the early American of that time show. In that regard, the acting in this is truly about 20 years ahead of its time, compared to American and most German productions, of the same time period.I was absolutely gripped by the storytelling, especially the last 4 episodes or so and even founded it to be tense and excitement, something not too common for an over 90 years old production, even though the story also became quite ridicules at times. Perhaps the only flaw in the storytelling is that they kept bringing in new characters, also very late in the serial, such as the real main villain that only gets revealed in I believe the 7th episode. if I remember correctly. It makes the whole story a bit too hard to follow- and not always completely interesting and credibly at times.It is well cast and especially Musidora as the über-lady vamp Irma Vep is great and impressive. She is both sensual as dangerous in her role. What a great early classic character of cinema. Also Marcel Lévesque is great, as the sort of comical relief of the serials and Édouard Mathé also plays a likable main character.There are some really daring and dangerous, for its time looking, stunts in this production. It also really adds to the tension and excitement of it all.The production design is great and its like going back in time when watching this. The serial cleverly uses some camera-color filters for each location and mood, to add to the atmosphere and storytelling of the entire serial.It all in all is an overall very well put together interesting historical big-production, that still remains perfectly watchable by todays standards, thanks to its exciting storytelling and build up.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Feuillade has become much more popular abroad than in his native France where his movies are seldom screened on ""cultural TV ,the Arte Channel or the ""Cinema De Minuit"".Some critics call ""Les Vampires"" brainwashing at a time when France was at war .Some critics praise it to the skies.I'm for the golden middle .Feuillade was certainly important in the shaping of the serial (along ""the perils of Pauline"" in America)but he was not as great a director as his contemporaries David Wark Griffith and Abel Gance (whose career did not begin with ""Napoleon"" in 1926).The screenplay of ""Les Vampires"" is pretty silly,definitely weaker than that of ""Fantomas"" and it is sure easy to see why: ""Fantomas "" was first a set of volumes written by Pierre Souvestre and Marcel Allain -and Feuillade botched the first chapters which were the best of the saga :see Paul Fejos's ""Fantomas"" (1932) for that matter.But the rest was quite acceptable,some movies(the third episode :""Le Mort Qui Tue"" notably) highly commendable.""Les Vampires"" was a different matter ,because it was an original screenplay and the writer/director had to kill the ""Chef Des Vampires"" ,not because he thought the audience needed change ,but because it was the war and the actors were mobilized.That's why Feuillade gave up making ""lEs Vampires"" after 10 episodes and opted for a ""good "" hero ,Judex ,a conjurer fighting against the villains.The stories are far-fetched to a fault ,pleasant to watch,but not particularly memorable (Maurice Leblanc was writing much more brilliant stories at the time featuring his hero Arsene Lupin who is much more exciting than his bland hero Philippe Guérande and his mate/undertaker.Much more than the stories,it's the details that are interesting: the maid Mrs Guerande hires is a Girl from Britanny ,and at the time most of the servants came from that region:this was the subject of Becassine ,a comic strip of the era;it's interesting to note that whereas the villains have lovers,the hero,after losing his fiancée in the second chapter-and he doesn't even shed a tear-,remains chaste till the ...ninth episode in which he finds another one.Musidora's famous black tight caused an outcry : the series remained famous for her but she only appears in her outfit in two brief moments: one when she's scrawling on the roofs and the other one in a hotel where she also appears (that crowns it!) dressed as a young man complete with mustache .Feuillade's most salutary quality was story -telling :even if the plot seems too often too much ,we can't help but admire the way he uses the pictures and thus keeps his lines to the minimum -a thing many of his colleagues could not do-.Feuillade's influence in France?One sees little of it in the great directors of the Golden Era (Carné,Renoir,Guitry,Duvivier,Et Al). Feuillade's influence shows ,however,in one of Duvivier's silent films "" Le Mystere De La Tour Eiffel"" or even in Clair's ""Le Fantome Du Moulin Rouge"" .Feuillade 's most dedicated follower was Georges Franju who made a remake of ""Judex""(1963) and ""Les Nuits Rouges""(1973) ,a failed attempt at a seventies ""Vampires"".Most of this director's works have something of Feuillade : ""Les Yeux Sans Visage""(1959) ""La Tête Contre Les Murs"" (1960)""Pleins Feux Sur L'Assassin"".(1961)In the seventies,Feuillade's touch appeared again in Rivette's stuff ,but it's reserved for intellectuals.What was once the most popular French cinema of an era became one inspiration for the most cerebral (who said boring?) art."

","Lensed in an eerily abandoned Paris in 1915, Louis Feuillade's stark chapterplay LES VAMPIRES is a grim and powerful work which is worlds apart from the later glitz and polish of the golden age serials produced by the American studios.It should be noted that serials were nothing new at this point in time. Formative efforts such as THE PERILS OF PAULINE had already established the appeal of these generally inexpensive actioners, with their bizarre twists and inventive death traps.The emphasis was generally on a resourceful protagonist pitted against an equally inventive and determined fiend -- frequently an unsuspected heir or lawyer out to obtain an undeserved inheritance.LES VAMPIRES did this formula one better, making the menace a vast and largely unsuspected criminal empire which is devouring Paris from inside. With members taken from all classes, the dark society is able to plunder, blackmail and murder without dear of action from the authorities. This continues until their removal of a government investigator brings ambitious reporter Philippe Guerande (Edouard Mathe) into things.Sent to the country to search for details on the official's murder, Philippe plans to combine business and pleasure by meeting Dr. Lox, an old family friend who has a chateau in the area.Arriving at Lox's estate at the same time as an American heiress who means to purchase the property, the reporter is promptly framed for theft by the hooded agents of the gang, who are secreted in the ancient building.Locating the dead investigator's head, Philippe manages to turn suspicion on Lox. Murdering the heiress and making his escape across the rooftops, the ""doctor"" is revealed as the Grand Vampire the (evident) leader of the criminal society.Philippe falls into the Vampires' hands but is rescued by Oscar Cloud Mazamette (Marcel Levesque) -- a clerk and minor member of the gang whom he had helped earlier. Philippe and Mazamette combine to try to expose the society's operations and bring the gang to a deserved end.A series of adventures follow, with the Grand Vampire (Fernand Herrmann) and exotic dancer/criminal Irma Vep (Musidora) providing much of the opposition. In a surprise development, it is revealed that the Grand Vampire is not the gang's ultimate leader. When it is convenient, his superior eliminates him. He, in turn, commits suicide when he is imprisoned by the police.Satanas, the criminal mastermind behind the group's poisons and explosives steps in and assumes co-command with Irma Vep. This occurs too late, however, as Philippe is closing in on the gang's chief meeting place.After a series of close calls, the reporter and the reformed Mazamette succeed in destroying the Vampires' leadership and bringing the rank and file members to justice.Not enough emphasis can be placed on the serial's grim and stark look, which almost functions as a characters of its own. This is a Paris where the gang's activities have seemingly terrified the people to the degree that they refuse to venture out unless it is absolutely unavoidable.Production took place during WW I, when the streets were largely abandoned, and this strange desolation combines with the scurrying of the few characters to present a powerful emphasis that goes beyond the actual turns and twists of the plotline. The result is compelling, entertaining, and more than a bit weird in spots. Tinted scenes add to the welcome air of unreality.Definitely a 9 out of 10 possible points."

","I knew next to nothing about this serial before starting on the first installment. I had mild expectations, figuring it would be a struggle to pay attention and not get bored. Boy, was I wrong! It starts of with a fast pace, leading you into a mystery with twists and turns and exciting villains. Following the young reporter, it's almost like an excellent Tintin-adventure. In fact, there are many parallels to Tintin that can be made, including a clumsy friend that happens upon great wealth.Sadly, it loses a lot of momentum about midway through. As far as I can understand, there was no script (only a general idea), and it kind of shows. I assume the Irma Vep and Mazamette-characters were the most popular, because they become more and more involved in the storyline as it progresses. After a while, Guérande (the hero reporter) is almost completely overshadowed by the ""supporting cast"". Musidora is fantastic as Irma Vep, and it's hard to complain about there being more of her - but it does lead to a less interesting story. As you eventually follow the villains almost as much as the protagonist, there is no longer any mystery to it. The twists and turns doesn't matter, because they often don't surprise you. When it comes to Marcel Lévesque's performance as Mazamette, it was probably better in its time than it is now. As (almost) the only character, he constantly looks at the camera, acting as if it was a slapstick comedy. The same goes for his son, who appears later.Don't get me wrong, there are still thrilling scenes, stunts and twists in the latter episodes, but they are few and far apart, and not enough to save the entire series. Maybe it would have been better if I had not ""binge-watched"" it, but from what I hear, that's how it's usually shown in screenings.Had the rest of the serial been as good as the first 4-5 installments, this would have been an excellent introduction to silent film."

","""Les Vampires"" (1915 - 398 minutes - B&W) is a classic of the mute cinema series directed by Louis Feuillade. In ten episodes, it counts the adventures of a masked assailants group who haunt Paris. The mythical actress Musidora [ the first ""Vamp"" of the European cinema ] is the star in the series, that achieved fame due to the great admiration among the surrealists (Andres Breton and Luis Buñuel were its bigger fans), seduced by the dreamily scenes that sometimes appears in the narrative. At first ""Les Vampires"" was rejected for the French vanguard directors, that considered it like a mere policeman series. The film was saved from destruction thanks to the efforts of the founder of the French Film library, Henri Langlois, and after years forgotten, ""Les Vampires"" was exhibited again in the sixties, in concurred sessions that had marked time, especially in Paris, London and New York, causing a reevaluation of the critics relatively to the work of Feuillade. Andres Bazin, the great critic of the French cinema, said that ""Les Vampires"" was ""one of the biggest film of all the times"", admiration shared with the directors of the new French cinema. Today, Feuillade is placed side by side to other geniuses of the mute period of the cinema, as Griffith, Stroheim, Murnau and Gance. The episodes: 1: The Cut Head (31 minutes); 2: The Ring that Kills (13 minutes); 3: The Red Book (39 minutes); 4: The Specter (30 minutes); 5: The Escape of the Dead Man (35 minutes); 6: Hypnotic eyes (53 minutes); 7: Satanus (42 minutes); 8: The Master of the Thunder (50 minutes); 9: The Poisoner (48 minutes); 10: The Terrible Marriage (57 minutes)."

Basically it is a six hour thirty-nine minute serial, a long film split into ten parts, The Severed Head, The Killer Ring, The Red Cypher, The Ghost, The Escaping Dead Man, The Hypnotic Gaze, Satanas, The Thunder Lord, The Poisoner and Bloody Wedding. It all revolves around an intrepid reporter and his loyal friend doing a little investigation, but mainly a society of criminals called The Vampires. The gang of criminals are led by Le Grand Vampire (Jean Aymé), and one of the most well known members is fake stage actress and Femme Fetale, Irma Vep (Musidora), her name is an anagram of the word ""vampire"". Memorable moments in the serial include a few bodies carried on back, Irma Vep dressed as a bat, a box with a head in it (maybe Se7en was inspired), chases on rooftops, Irma Vep in the back skintight catsuit doing her dirty work, the swapping of the back costumes and the sleeping bodies, amongst other things. Also starring Édouard Mathé as Philippe Guérande, Marcel Lévesque as Oscar Mazamette, Fernand Herrmann as Juan-José Moréno, Stacia Napierkowska as Marfa Koutiloff and Renée Carl as L'Andalouse.

","Now here's a movie that doesn't require a replication of Paris in the early 20th century. The real McCoy is used for the settings, vehicles, costumes, firearms, etc. Since it was filmed in 1916 one can see for example how horse-drawn carriages were still a very popular means of transport in the ""modern"" sense. If you a true fan of motion picture history -- then you can't afford to miss this gem. It represents the dawn of the motion picture industry before we had well-known movie stars and blockbusters like Intolerance (1916) and Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919).This film, a series of 10 episodes, tells the story of a gang of thieves and murderers (The Vampire Gang) who are out to create havoc in Paris for their own personal goals. The heros of this tale are a newspaper reporter, Phillipe Guerande, and his hilarious sidekick, Mazamette. Together they aim to foil the latest capers of the gang and find themselves in unexpected trouble throughout the entire series. Ingenious methods by the criminals are used in each episode.Each episode builds upon the first, so I strongly recommend you watch it in sequence (as if you watching the Sopranos on HBO). It's interesting to see how the characters develop and improve their acting as they gain experience and confidence within their roles. Irma Vep and Mazamette, especially are a treat to watch. Later in the series, both Irma Vep and Mazamete deliberately ham it up for the viewing audience and camera just for fun! Guerande reminded me a lot of Gene Kelly with his clean-cut facial expressions and haircut. Only the last episode (#10) was a disappointment. For some reason, much of the print was washed out in the interior scenes, the tinting inconsistent (many outdoor scenes were red instead of green etc.) and the storyline was unrealistically forced forward (i.e., how did Mazamette enter into Guerande's house at 2:00 am uninvited and how did Guerande climb down the 3rd floor balcony of the Vampires' mansion after he threw away their knotted rope, the Vampires' only means of escape from that level?)Most episodes are 45 minutes in length, except #10 which is nearly a hour. Even though the entire series runs over 8 hours, don't watch it a double speed as suggested by a previous reviewer. The score adds ambience, suspense & excitement to the Parisian scenes at the appropriate places. Lastly there are two supplements on the DVD. The first is a royal waste (a true supernavel, or ""turnip"" according to the French), the second is a cute story starring the young boy who played Mazamette's son in ""Les Vampires""."

The filmmaker makes extensive use of real Parisian street locations, which seem always, oddly, to be drained of pedestrian life; watching ""Les Vampires"" is like getting into a time machine.View ""Les Vampires"" first, then see ""Irma Vep"" (France, 1996) so you have a point of reference."
87,12-tt0006206,Les vampires,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006206/," Before graphic novels, or television, there was LES VAMPIRES.
","I think that if I had seen this, I don't know, ten or more years ago, I wouldn't have this association but, watching Les vampires, maybe the first real groundbreaking piece of epic filmmaking to come out of France during the ""pre-sound"" era (I don't know about all of Europe since Cabiria was a year before and, come to think of it, this director also did Fantomas just before this, so I may be off completely)... this all seems like the precursor to countless graphic novels (think of the hardboiled stuff but also Superman and Batman to an extent in those worlds) and other pulp serials. In a way this is in league or the same ballpark as Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler, which is also a story of arch criminals and the cops and newspapermen on their trails, and both have an approach to storytelling that is plot driven (though Louis Feuillade is especially concerned with the storytelling twists and turns and mounting of suspense more than Lang, who could pause more often for creating mood and atmosphere). It's a story that is a procedural of the hunt AND about the criminals - and is really about, in each 'episode', drawing out the suspense of a moment and a beat and how, as we can assume, someone will get out of the jam they've been put in, whether that's the criminal or the intrepid Globe writer Philippe Gerande (even that seems to have been echoed years later in certain comic books).So much happens in the seven hours of this ""film"" (I'll call it that, but put quotes around it as it's technically a serial, but hey, it's a full work at the end of it all), and to recount every turn of the story would miss the point of its effectiveness. The interest in Feuillade's stories is to draw the audience in finding more clues on the Gerande's side - and, eventually, the former undertaker Mazamette with his mustache and nose and (a little too much) looking at the camera for audience emphasis as his sometimes partner - and then, perhaps daringly, into how the vampires work on their end. There's equal time spent between Gerande's side of the story, as well as some of the other characters connected with him like his mother (there's a terribly exciting episode where she gets kidnapped by the vampires and how she gets out of it is fantastic as it relies on a plant earlier that gets paid off, so to speak, that we almost don't expect), and then on the side of Irma Vep, the non-vampire-but-still-very-much-criminal Moreno, and the others like the villainous scientist who Irma ultimately falls for, and Satanas, the ""Grande Vampire"" of them all.What this does is not so much make us feel more sympathetic to them, they are the villains in a story that isn't subtle about drawing the distinctions between good and not, but to have us understand them as people, however they might be duplicitous in their line of operations, and a character like Irma Vep becomes the most memorable thing about this all for a reason. The actress, called only 'Musidora', has wild eyes that can pierce through anything, and how she moves around a space or a room, and then how those eyes can connect with someone, transforms the space she's in. Why does she do these acts of robbery and cat-thievery (more on that in a second), and, eventually, killing or at least by association? Because she can, just like all the other vampires. There's no grand political statement to what they do, outside perhaps of their disregard for morals or being 'proper' (there's a practically ritualistic dance that the characters do in the middle of a room that gets repeated), and she's that classic comic-book sort of villainess: cunning, ruthless, sometimes vicious, also playful, and in her 1915 way sexy as hell (her in that black suit, man). If any of the Batman writers and creators saw this, it'd be clear as day she was the inspiration for Catwoman (I have no way of knowing that, it's an assumption I'm reading in to).Louis Feuillade isn't exactly out for the *most* realistic depiction of a story of criminals and heroes, but it also sees cinema as an art form to be used for the utmost effect to give information (there's a great many newspaper clipping to look at to move the plot forward), and he's creating his own simple and effective cinematic grammar to keep the audience invested. This doesn't mean the series isn't without some share of flaws, much as a run of a graphic novel series might run out of steam closer to the latter issues, like introducing some new characters fairly late into the game (i.e. Mazamette's son Eustache is an annoyance, and Philippe's eventual fiancé is clearly there to be used, sooner rather than later, as another figure to be kidnapped by the vampires). It'd also be advised to not watch it all in one sitting but to parse it out if you can over a few nights; some of the turns and twists - and physicality like at times falling out of windows (watch out for that noose coming your way to pull you down!) - are repetitive. All this noted, it's still a tremendous achievement in pulp fiction storytelling, with the stakes and drama building up more and more as the episodes go on, and if you can buy into some (though not all) of the acting of the period there's a lot of amazing work done as well, most of all by Musidora, but also the actresses in the later episodes do wonderfully too."

","I suppose it behooves us to know the history of cinema. Its not that long and some of this early stuff had unintended and possibly outrageous influence.The situation was that in the ten years prior there were all sorts of possibilities for film. It could have been an extension of painting, of dance, of photography (which then had a strong artistic tradition). But ""birth of a nation"" terminated all futures (at least until recently) and froze film as an extension of theater. That's a crying shame.This series is one of many varieties of drama that followed that final freezing. The template comes from magazine serials, still influenced by the Conan Doyle influence of the Holmes stories. There had to be secret cabals of thieves with extraordinary, inscrutable powers. There had to be a detective, in this early incarnation still a reporter. There had to be incredible devices and poisons and tricks. Shady getaways and hair-raising escapes.But those magazine series were drek, and so is this. But stuck it has, and the episodic adventures of TeeVee detectives  especially those of the sixties  followed the pattern. In fact, the pattern even extended to vast periods of time just watching people walk, climb (we have to see the whole thing) and run. In modern times, this extended to the convenient TeeVee filler of watching the detectives walk to their car, get in, start up and drive away. We have to see the entire thing. There's no art here, no innovation in framing, tone... any element. Just a history lesson in how the banal became acceptable.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
89,14-tt0006206,Les vampires,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006206/," Fantastical Folly
","I've only seen about two-thirds of this series so far, but seeing as it took Lovefilm more than six months to send me the second disc in the collection after I returned the first I figured I should review it now before the whole thing fades from memory. The most striking thing about the series is how fantastical the stories are – even though there isn't a real vampire in sight (which is a bit of a let-down really). The world of Les Vampires is one in which gangs of skilled thieves prey on the wealthy; in which every handshake or pat on the back may result in paralysis of the recipient thanks to a tiny poisonous dart strapped to their attacker's hand; in which nefarious villains hypnotise women into believing they are in love with them, and in which police remove floorboards to create a trap for unsuspecting criminals, then truss them in a giant sack and carry them off to jail.It all sounds like a lot of fun really, doesn't it? Especially the hypnotism bit. Unfortunately, the episodes of this famous silent serial from Louis Feuillade do have a tendency to drag. This is more an indication of how public expectations have changed in the ninety-plus years since this serial was produced than it is of a weakness in the films, I suppose, but to try to appreciate a film from the perspective of the audience for which it was initially intended is damn near impossible.The story revolves around the efforts of Philippe Guerande and Mazzematte, his ex-undertaker sidekick and (fairly hopeless) comic relief, to bring to justice the members of Les Vampires Crime Enterprise (French Division). This being a serial lasting many hours, their attempts are, more often than not, foiled, although a villain is occasionally nabbed only for a new face to declare that he is the real leader of the gang, and the other bloke was just his lackey. Mazzematte casts supposedly comical glances at the audience and sometimes pulls childlike faces while Guerande is all charm and capability. Prominent amongst the villains is Mlle Musidora as the femme fatale Irma Vep, who is quite fond of sneaking around in a black body stocking that makes her look alarmingly lumpy.Like the guy who plays Mazzematte, she plays to the camera – although possibly not quite as intentionally – pulling strange faces and striking over-dramatic poses and postures. It's all quite distracting, but offers some amusement when the story starts to drag. Serials would grow more fast-paced and exciting in the 20s, but this was no doubt considered something of a class act in 1915, and is still worth a look today (if you've got about nine hours to spare) even though it's unlikely to make it into anybody's top ten list."

","Finished this tonight after watching it over the past few days. At almost seven hours long, and divided into 10 parts averaging about 30-40 minutes each, it wasn't really sensible to watch it in one go. And due to the episodic nature of it all and the way it is a little repetitive at points, I wouldn't recommend a marathon session at all.That repetition is the only real complaint I have. It's okay for each part to hit similar beats, but there is a lot of hidden identities, kidnappings, and last-minute escapes, to the point where you sometimes wonder why some characters don't learn from them when it all keeps on happening.But in other ways the series does find ways to shake things up and keep things fresh. There were a few twists and turns I didn't see coming, there was one character who I was sure it was so obvious faked their death because it happened off screen... and it turned out nope, they really died, and in general, the series is surprisingly willing to knock off supporting characters and replace them.There's also some good action and stunts for the time it was made, and seeing crime elements play out in a really early film (that would go on to influence others) was a lot of fun, especially because crime films are one of my favourite genres. For those interested in silent movies, the action/crime genre's origins, or epic movies, Les Vampires is easy to recommend, and overall, the problems I had with it at times were pretty minimal."

","Serials are a low point in film history, and the period around the Great War was bad for the French film industry, as well. Commemorating both is ""Les Vampires,"" probably one of the best-remembered serials and the most accessible French motion picture of any kind from its era.Serials are banal sensationalism aimed at lowbrow tastes. They always have been, from their inception in magazines, newspapers and other cheap literature, which has continued to this day with television. It's always been economical--promising return customers looking for a satisfying wrapping up of previous installments' cliffhangers and loose ends. Usually, the budgets for them are quite thrifty. Additionally, it doesn't require much imagination if one repackages the same devices for each episode--and even less if one repackages the same devices from previous serials--all of which Louis Feuillade, more or less, did here. In many ways, TV series are today's serials.Feuillade further popularized serials in France, which was probably inescapable anyhow with the flood of American films (and serials) into the cinemas. For some reason, he seems to have garnered more respect than any other maker of chapter plays has--even to this day. I don't know of any other director mostly known for serials offhand. His pictures have had widespread popularity in their day, but also ""Les Vampires"" seems to remain one of the most praised representations of 1910s cinema. It's not evident that it has anything to do with a mastery of film-making, though; to the contrary, I think that's absent. The long takes from fixed camera positions get very boring, especially the scenes of extended length--those of the characters' every action: scaling buildings, driving off in automobiles, how exactly they go about their crimes and such, as fellow commenter tedg and others have described. This is similar to the practice in early cinema that film historians have called the ""operational aesthetic,"" but which was dated even by 1915.As other filmmakers did, Feuillade alters tinting to suggest changes of light within the story. Other filmmakers, especially those in Denmark, actually changed the lighting of the scene for the change in light within the scene, which usually required a well-positioned splice. Otherwise, like Feuillade, Danish filmmakers from around this time tended to avoid editing and camera movement, too, but they replaced it with innovations in mise-en-scène, which aid the camera in creating brilliant images, as can editing and movement of the camera. Such innovation, staging, composition, or mastery is lacking in ""Les Vampires."" The actors do all the work, and the camera just sits there.You might, but I don't like this serial's content, either. It's a series of convoluted story lines involving a reporter detective and his sidekick Mazamette (played by an awful mugger of an actor) trying to rid Paris of Irma Vep and the underworld criminal gang known as the ""vampires."" To me it seems to be nearly seven hours of each side ineptly attempting to capture, imprison or kill the other.In episode eight: Why did they give Mazamette's child a gun, and why did they originate such an elaborate scheme to arrest the bad guy in the first place? Why would they use a kid? Where was a gun in the hands of a decent shot when it should have been in other scenes? And, the vampires require a justice to arrive after enough time has been provided for possible escape to declare their prisoner guilty, although, to their credit, they never do that again. Anyhow, you see my point.(*Review title taken from ""The Serial Speaks,"" New York Dramatic Mirror, which is quoted in the chapter on serials in ""The Oxford History of World Cinema."")"
92,17-tt0006206,Les vampires,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006206/," Reviews for episodes 1-4 (more to come, perhaps)
","This French crime serial from the 1910s is one of the few silent serials left (and probably one of the only ones available for consumption). Louis Feuillade is its director. I watched the first four episodes (the tapes come each with four episodes of varying length) and will give a brief review of each. SPOILERSEpisode 1: The Severed Head - I was a little afraid that Les Vampires was going to be really bad when I was sitting through The Severed Head. We are introduced to a journalist, Phillipe, who is hot on the trail of a notorious gang called the Vampires, which is the subject of his daily reports in the newspaper. An important lawkeeping official has been found dead, decapitated. Phillipe goes on the hunt, and the clues lead him to the home of Dr. Nox. Dr. Nox is currently showing his mansion to the mansion's potential buyer, an American woman. Long story short, this is a really weak film. The cinematic devices are still pretty new, but Feurillade shows no talent in using them or innovation in this first episode. It is unsuspenseful, slow, and somewhat laughable. 5/10.Episode 2: The Ring That Kills - This one's a lot better than the first one. This one is rather short compared to the other three on the first tape. Phillipe sets up a trap at a ballet. There is a really neat ballet number involving a woman dressed as a bat. Anyway, the plan doesn't go that well and Phillipe gets captured. Luckily, Mazamette, a friend of his, has infiltrated the hideout of the Vampires. Phillipe is freed, and they capture a Vampire and put him in his place (he is about to be executed). All in all, The Ring That Kills is pretty goofy (some of the humor is intentional, some is not), but it is a pretty effective crime movie. 7/10.Episode 3: The Red Cypher - Phillipe takes a few days off of work in order to decipher the codes in a book he has found on the Vampire whom he got killed in his place at the end of Episode 2. The Vampires devise a way to get into his house using false identities. A replacement maid, whose real name is Irma Vep (which you might recognize as the title of a French film from the 1990s), tries to poison Phillipe, but he tricks her as well. Phillipe's mother gets captured, but she also finds a clever way out of her dilemma. By now, this series is still quite silly, but it's pretty entertaining, especially in plot. The cinematic devices are still not used in any fantastic way, but the plot is getting a bit cleverer. Still a 7/10, but nearly an 8/10.Episode 4: The Spectre - This one was a little confusing in its plot. I must have blinked at the wrong moment and missed an expositional intertitle. There's little of interest besides a decently directed and edited murder sequence in a train, good for its time, anyways, and Phillipe's reconnaissance of an office in which Irma Vep is spying, disguised as a secretary. Also, the final scene has a neat little thing in it: Phillippe and Mazamatte are talking on the phone, both of them present in the same shot. Between them is edited a shot of a bridge, a metaphor for the connection between phone lines. It's pretty dumb, but at least Feuillade was trying here.Conclusion for Episodes 1-4: all in all, an interesting bit of early cinema, but The Vampires really doesn't hold up very well today. It's mostly just a rather flat series of crime stories, perhaps like the kind that might have appeared in a weekly detective magazine or something, filmed straight without invention or embellishment. Sure, it's still early as heck in the cinema, but by the end of the silent period the art form had gone light years beyond Les Vampires. I wish I were more familiar with D.W. Griffith. He's a contemporary of Feuillade's, and the few bits of his films that I have seen seem much more advanced than this serial. I don't want to make a definitive statement on the comparison between the two, though, until I see one of Griffith's films. Even the earlier films by the Lumiere Brothers, Georges Melies, and the Thomas Edison company seem a lot more amazing today than does this. I might see more of the serial if I ever get a chance to see it for free, but I doubt I'd pay any more money to rent them."
93,18-tt0006206,Les vampires,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006206/," LENGTHY ""VAMPIRES"" NOT MONUMENTAL BUT STILL FUN
","Louis Feuillade may have been an early French pioneer of silent shorts but ""Les Vampires"" is still bogged down in plot contrivances.  Technically speaking it is difficult to view this today as it was upon its release, as 10 separate films, because we're not returning to the theater weekly to see the next great piece of the puzzle. And at 7 plus hours long, to view it in one sitting can be an act of futility and frustration.Feuillade's great strength was short films but with most of these 10 episodes reaching 45 minutes apiece, he extended his stay a large part of the time, serial or not.  Designed as a crime saga with comic relief and unrealistic plot devices, ""Les Vampires"" has been compared to early James Bond and has been mentioned as being influential on Hitchcock. I don't see it. At best it can be compared to the weekly serials shown in theaters in the 50's, early pulp fiction, and the Pink Panther series.  That's not an insult but I'm not giving out credit unjustly either. None of these take away from the fun of the work.The Vampires are a sinister (take that lightly) crime gang that is plaguing the streets of Paris circa 1915. Edouarde Mathe's Philippe Guarande and Marcel Levesque's Mazamette are the journalist and sidekick who pursue the group. The Vampires most featured member is second-in-command Irma Vep played by Musidora and she actually is rather sexy. The Vampires leader, the Grand Vampire, actually changes three different times during the story and it is the little nuances like this that spoil the film.Whereas having fun can be quite entertaining, plot can kill the messenger even at this early stage of cinematic history. The poison pens, portable cannons, and paralyzing pin pricks can all be strategically crafty when used appropriately, particularly in a serial series, but they lose their humorous magic when we can't even believe in the people using them. The Vampires, this menace that stalks the rich of Paris and robs them blind, are arguably the clumsiest and most unplanned organization I've ever seen wear black in a movie. Juan Jose Moreno, played by Fernand Herrmann, leads a rival crime syndicate that battles wits with the Vampires and the Guarande/Mazamette team. From the time Moreno enters the film, he successfully thwarts every single Vampire scheme hatched as they cannot do anything right. Indeed were Irma Vep not so sexy she would not be worth having around. She fails at practically every assignment she is given yet not only continually gets away but also is still a highly desired commodity by both the Grand Vampire and Moreno himself.Of course we know why these continual lapses in anything reminiscent of an actual plot and purpose occur...Feuillade has to push this baby to ten episodes to entertain the masses of 1915 for whom it was intended. But Feuillade does show some weakness here even above his writing by playing scenes out extraordinarily too long. In fact by virtue of trimming seconds off of every scene that went on too long ""Les Vampires"" could have made an excellent feature length picture around 210 minutes and we could have cleared up the ridiculous plot lapses to boot.From an acting standpoint it is neither forgettable nor excellent with the possible exception of Levesque's Mazamette character who steals the show with his hilarious mannerisms and comic imagery. While appearing to be a foolish sidekick early on, by the film's end he actually does more and knows more to catch the bumbling Vampires than anyone else on screen. And he's not even the star. If any influencing went on here it was Mazamette's character on Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau.The nutshell: great fun if it weren't so unnecessarily long. Like early pulp fiction its nonstop use of dastardly doings, devious schemes, and nasty devices may keep you coming back for the next episode time and time again (same bat time, same bat channel) but the plot will probably slow you down in the end. Possibly worth watching to get a look at early French cinema but when compared to Griffith like all 1912-1920 films must be, Feuillade doesn't even come close...6/10."
94,19-tt0006206,Les vampires,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006206/," Unpredictable, full of Feuillade's stunning visuals and Musidora: simply unforgetable
","Seven hours of fun in the most crazy and fascinating serial ever made.Far from the polished finish of Tih Minh, Les vampires is a carefree and unpredictable mess shot mostly in desolate Parisian suburbs and painted interiors of mansions, improvising plots based on the actors available at any given moment (among them an unforgettable Musidora) and with the freshness of the unexpected and the fortuitous.The best thing about the serial is Feuillade's visual imagination, his absolutely unpredictable character, an always frenetic pace and the presence of Musidora as Irma Vamp, number 2 of the vampire clan, although she herself is capable of surviving four bosses of the gang. Her appearance in the third episode is unforgettable, on the stage of a low-life cabaret, where the criminal gang meets between Apaches and criminals to plan their hits and enjoy their wild dances. But her best-known image is clad in a tight black suit during any of her misdeeds.It is true that there is a marked evolution throughout the chapters that increasingly abandons the macabre initial triumphs of the gang (which initially leaves a trail of dead in its wake), towards a less lethal attitude, focusing on kidnappings or failed attempts of murder, possibly because of the censorship that did not see with good eyes that the criminal gang got away with it and repeatedly outwitted the forces of order. It's like a gradual descent from the menacing atmosphere of Fantomas to the much more tolerable one of a Judex or Tih Minh. Even so, the last chapters include some of the best moments of the entire serial.Feathers loaded with lethal ink, poisoned rings, strange hiding places behind paintings on the walls, safes with false bottoms, portable cannons fired from simple hotel rooms, and naturally many hooded, rooftops, trunks and car chases.If vampires are the ones keeping our interest, law enforcement doesn't fare so well: journalist Philippe Guerande (played by a rather bland Edouard Mathé) and his collaborator Mazamette (a mostly insufferable Marcel Lévesque of highly questionable humor) they earn our respect by their goodwill and little else.Without the budget of its other great serials, in the midst of the First World War, Les Vampires does not hide its flimsy doors that look like cardboard, its painted carpentry on the walls, and some rudimentary special effects, but everything adds to its charm and its attractive lack of respectability.Feuillade only intends to surprise us, amuse us, immerse us in an atmosphere of delirium, oneirism and rejection of all logic, and give us a handful of absolutely fascinating images along the way."

","Les Vampires (1915) :
Brief Review -7 hours into the Greatest Storytelling ever appeared on Earth in Crime or Gangster Genre. It's time to forget all the classic crime dramas i have seen from 30s, 40s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s because here is the grandfather of all Gangster Films. I am not a huge fan of crime dramas, rather i have a certain hatred for this genre because the kind of bad characters and negativity it carries but there were some films which were actually good enough to be accepted as Classics and that's why i have been trying to avoid Les Vampires from last couple of years. Now, i happily regret for being such a fool to avoid this magnus Opus and Cinematic masterpiece. It has just stunned me like.. totally, completely and massively. First, i don't believe it was made in 1915 because the storytelling of this serial film is at least 200 years ahead of its time which means i can watch this film in year 2115 and still like it same as i do now after 106 years of its original release. Louis Feuillade's visionary direction is superlative at every level from handling the long length to keeping it interested throughout 7 hours. I was hooked for 7 hours, can you believe it? Watching silent film for 7 hours and still not getting bored, this is a stupendous achievement in itself. It has so many iconic scenes, thrilling materialism, uncountable turn-around moments, plenty of twists and minimum 100+ influential catalogues that were later copied by film geniuses like Fritz Lang and Hitchcock in their popular classic films. I don't know where to bash this film and how to appreciate this unachievable towering film in words so that i can convince everyone to watch it at any cost. I would only say this, whatever your favourite crime drama is, this one is far ahead of it, agree or die. Hats off to the entire for this astonishing cinematic gem. If you don't like it then sorry, i can't help you, you're a great fool.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest"

","A review by episodes:Episode 1 - The Severed Head (6/10)
Not an incredibly strong start to the series, though it's not without intrigue and menace. A reporter who has been investigating an organization called Les Vampires goes out to a chateau to see about the death of an inspector who was decapitated by the same group. As a fair warning, despite the name and a rather iconic image that appears in episode 2, there are no actual vampires or Dracula-type characters in this series. If you were expecting that, you might find the cat burglar character we see in this first episode rather disappointing. A rich American woman has her jewels stolen in the night by a sleek man in black via hidden passageways, you see. The thief seen gingerly walking along the roof and shimmying down a railing was frankly a bit of a letdown, even knowing that he was just a taste of things to come. The plot thickens when the severed head is recovered and further murders are committed, whereupon the first episode ends. It's probably unfair to review this 33 minute short in isolation (kind of like reviewing a single chapter of a book), and I fully expect the series to get better as it goes along.Episode 2 - The Ring that Kills (8/10)
The image of Marfa (Stacia Napierkowska) in that black bodysuit, slowly spreading her bat wings back while on tiptoe, surely has to rate among the silent era's best. And gosh, a justice of the Supreme Court involved in clandestine, corrupt activities with a mysterious shadow organization, hmmm who would have thought that was possible? This installment is short and sweet at just 15 minutes, but the murder onstage and introduction into the lair of Les Vampires are wonderful.Episode 3 - The Red Cryptogram (7/10)
Pretty cool to see the Irma Vep character (Musidora) and the special effects, 1915-style, rearranging the letters to spell Vampire. She was of course the reference for the 1996 film with Maggie Cheung. The criminal organization that Philippe Guérande (Édouard Mathé) is up against is pretty sinister, with poisoned ink that kills within seconds after skin contact (something that would make Vladimir Putin proud), and resorting to attacks at home and kidnapping. It's a little slow-moving at 39 minutes for such a simple episode, but the groundwork continues to be laid for an entertaining series. The traitor to Les Vampires, Mazamette (Marcel Lévesque) and strong mother character (Delphine Renot) are nice touches too.Episode 4 - The Spectre (8/10)
The story to this episode relies on an enormously convenient coincidence - the leader of a separate crime ring who has just taken an apartment next to Irma Vep is the same guy who happens across the dead body of Les Vampires' latest victim - but there is enough ominous subterfuge afoot that I didn't mind. A guy is murdered with a hatpin and thrown off a train, for goodness sake, how cool is that for 1916. Operating in disguise is a recurring theme here - Irma acts as the secretary in a bank, Philippe Guérande shows up as a handyman, and the new criminal (Fernand Hermann) dresses up as the murder victim so convincingly that he appears as a ""spectre"" to Irma. There are two moments when the audience sees people laying in wait and getting close to battle, which must have been thrilling at the time, and still carries a certain amount of tension today. Fleeing down a manhole cover, getting access to a safe from a false real panel, and sneaking into a house with the aid of an accomplice - the slinking around here is fantastic, creating a world where good and evil fight as cat and mice, and nothing can be trusted. There's a nice little split screen action as well. It's great stuff, and does the most important thing in telling the larger story - makes me want to keep watching more episodes.Episode 5 - The Corpse's Escape (8/10)
It was clever to continue the thread of the rival gang to Les Vampires, the one led by Moréno, as it added an extra dimension to this already very entertaining series. It created double peril for Philippe Guérande, with Les Vampires capturing him spectacularly off his 2nd story balcony by using a loop connected to a long pole, and Moréno capturing him just as wonderfully when Guérande calls over to two cops and discovers to his chagrin that they are Moréno's cronies in disguise. Having two warring gangs also created opportunity for Guérande, however, ala ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend."" It's a triangle where each party is battling the other two, with the gangs robbing from each other and eluding capture, but also not quite able to kill off Guérande.In one of my favorite scenes, a crowd of socialites is gassed at a party, a moment that predates what you might see from the villains in Batman. As they all clamor to get out but find the windows boarded up and doors locked, we're treated to a slow raised tracking shot, one which shows a marble bust looking impassively on as the arms of the victims flail away. That was brilliant. There are lots of other little things here - good ol' Mazamette making a rubber mold of a lock to create a key, a large basket containing our hero falling down a long staircase, and of course, the fake cyanide tablet that results in the ""corpse"" rising at night to strangle the guard. Fantastic stuff, and a great episode.Episode 6 - Hypnotic Eyes (8/10)
Irma Vep (Musidora) is so cute with her short hair disguised as a young man, and of course in that black skintight outfit prowling around. In this episode, enter a pair of Americans on the run with $200,000 that they've stolen, which the two rival gangs, led by Moréno and the Grand Vampire, are hot on the trail for. Little do they realize that they've been beaten to the punch by Guérande and his sidekick Mazamette. Of the three horses in this race, you might say that Guérande comes in first, Moréno in second by virtue of kidnapping Irma Vep, and Les Vampires in last, losing out on the money, Irma, and yet another thing in a surprising finale.The hypnosis bit from Moréno, first performed on his maid (Mlle Maxa), was a wonderful touch, and I loved how he fell in love with Irma Vep once she was in his possession - and then used her for his nefarious purposes. The only off note was the killing of a couple of bulls in the recounted story from the Napoleonic era, which was needless narratively and cruel besides (one of the bulls gives chase to a rider on a horse before being brutally tripped by what looks like barbed wire, another is just lounging in a field before meeting its end). Despite the bad taste that left in my mouth, I really enjoyed this one, as apart from the maneuverings between the three parties, it showed just how varied these episodes were, and how spontaneous the storytelling could be.Episode 7 - Satanas (8/10)
Episode 7 starts with a rather astonishing intertitle that tells us that Irma Vep has not only been enslaved through the hypnotic powers of Moréno, but he's also made her his mistress, which I guess is shorthand for ""sex slave."" It's also pretty surprising that the Grand Master of the Vampires who was killed at the end of episode 6 has remained dead - but no worries, it turns out he was a subordinate to someone even higher - Satanas (Louis Leubas), a diabolical name if ever there was one. This guy shows up at Moréno's place knowing about the murder and pricking Moréno with a secret pin strapped to his palm, one that paralyzes him for five minutes. Just to make sure Moréno understands he's up against a superior power, later, at the press of a button, a high-tech cannon wheels out of a hidden door and he uses it to blow up a nightclub, which results in Moréno and Irma Vep meekly returning to the fold of Les Vampires.The cannon is quite a contrast to the teeny (and funny) guns that are bandied about throughout this series. In another use of technology, a clever ruse is devised whereby Irma Vep gets an American millionaire to speak into a portable sound recorder (uttering the only French phrase he knows, which is ""Paris has the most charming women."") He's also unwittingly signed over a bank order, and the scheme used against him - with Irma Vep posing as a bespectacled switchboard operator - reminded me of clever heist movies from decades later. It was also a treat to see Irma in a bohemian outfit, wearing many strands of pearls and one across her forehead. She's such a delight.The episode may lag a bit as the crime and its aftermath plays out, but it had built up enough equity with me that I didn't mind. There's lots of other nice little bits - a body in a crate dumped in the river from a bridge, the two cabaret dancers at the Joyeux Cagibi (the 'Happy Hideaway') trying but usually failing to stay in sync, the kidnapping of an innocent woman as she shrieks and struggles, and the cops using a trapdoor and giant sack to capture Moréno and Irma Vep instead of just surrounding them (lol). It's all very entertaining, and impressive for 1916.Episode 8 - The Thunder Master (8/10)
At the outset of episode 8, Irma Vep has been sent to prison, while Moréno has been executed by guillotine, which was dramatic even if it was only alluded to. As Irma is about to be shipped off to the French penal colony in Algeria, she gets the secret message that the ship carrying her will be blown up. We see the letters rearrange with the special effects of the day (in what seemed like a tough anagram!) and invisible ink revealed with the heat of the receiver's breath. Soon afterwards, we see the Grand Vampire Satanas bring his fancy cannon out in a hotel room (hey, it's portable too!) and proceed to fire upon the prison transport. Did Irma survive?Episode 9 - The Poison Man (7/10)
A slight step down in the series which really hit its stride in about episode 4, but entertaining nonetheless.Episode 10 - The Bloody Wedding (6/10)
At an even 60 minutes this is the longest episode, and there was not enough content. Out of room, thanks for reading this far."
99,24-tt0006206,Les vampires,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006206/," In praise of the bizarre.
","The protagonist of Les Vampires is Philipe Guérande, the reporter for an important newspaper who is dedicated to investigating a dangerous gang nicknamed The Vampires, dedicated to committing crimes and sowing terror. As the plot progresses we meet the two main figures of the group, the one nicknamed Great Vampire and his right hand Irma Vep. To them will be added another great criminal boss faced with The Vampires: José Moreno.
However, although Philipe is the protagonist, it is undeniable that the favorite characters of the spectators are, on the side of the antagonists, the fascinating Irma Vep, and on that of the protagonists, Philipe's friend, Mazamette.Much more recognizable with his showy mustache and with a more comical and mischievous character, Mazamette immediately wins the sympathy of the spectator despite his dark past as a former member of The Vampires. In fact, Feuillade accentuates our bond with him by making him one of the few characters who continually challenges the viewer by looking at the camera in an accomplice way, as if he is sharing with us what he thinks of each event by casting his ironic gaze.Throughout the series we see how Mazamette is the one who solves most of the plots, and also how he ends up indulging in the dissipated life of parties and women until his friend Guérande makes him see that this is not the way to behave for a respectable father of family. One of the most endearing details of the series are the jokes that his character makes continuously on camera until culminating in the last chapter with that funny moment when he faces a caricature of himself that The Vampires have made.When it comes to Irma Vep, she is without a doubt the serial's biggest draw. So much so that the actress who embodies it, Musidora, became an international star. Her peculiar wardrobe and the acrobatics that she performs while moving through buildings make her a unique character and far removed from the female clichés of the time. Here we have neither more nor less a really dangerous woman, with personality and with great strength. His first appearance in the serial, performing in a very suggestive way in a nightclub, is absolutely unforgettable. It is not by chance therefore that she is the only character in Les Vampires to have passed down to posterity.Finally, mention a secondary character that I particularly like: Philipe Guérande's mother, who is kidnapped by The Vampires and manages to escape by herself after deceiving and ending her kidnapper. Now that's a tough old lady!In one of the episodes, The Vampires send a note to Guérande's maid summoning her to a séance where she will be revealed who killed her husband. All this trick is destined to hypnotize her so that at night she opens the door for them so that they can infiltrate the Guérande house and finish off Philipe.Taking into account all the skills and means available to these dangerous criminals, it is hard to believe that, simply to gain access to someone else's home, they would have to resort to such a convoluted plan. But that is the grace of The Vampires, to recreate in the most gruesome plans possible. If all they did was force the door open with a master key, we would miss the séance and the disturbing image of the maid under hypnosis opening the door. The principle they seem to follow is: why commit a crime in a direct and crude way, being able to do it in the most intricate way possible?
Taking as a reference the pulp magazines of the time where situations also past thread were narrated, Les Vampires took a step further by putting in images those impossible situations that, in writing, forced the reader to imagine them as best they could. The grace of the serial is that Feuillade does not narrate a simple police plot, but recreates an uncertain universe in which everything is possible and there are no limits to the machiavellian plans of the antagonists. This gives the series an almost surreal air, in which we can take almost nothing for sure and we must let ourselves be carried away by the uncertain paths towards which the plot leads us.On the other hand, Les Vampires, in its overflowing imagination, shows us throughout its 10 episodes a curious arsenal of weapons that would be the envy of any James Bond, such as a murderous fountain pen, a top hat with a hidden bomb, a card containing poison or a glove with a built-in spike that causes the paralysis of the one to whom one gives the hand. We also see the imaginative use of a hatpin as a weapon and, my favorite, a cannon. In fact, one of my favorite moments of the serial is when the Great Vampire warns Irma Vep and José Moreno that at a specific time a signal will arrive as a warning for not wanting to ally with him. The Great Vampire, who does not exactly stand out for his subtlety, fires a cannon at the club where the two characters are and they obviously take themselves for granted.Of course there is no lack of séances, hypnosis, kidnappings or secret code books. Any element that evokes that mysterious and criminal world to the spectators of the time is mentioned in the film."
100,0-tt0006864,Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006864/," Fascinating - Even Its Flaws Are Interesting
","Everything about this movie is fascinating, even its numerous flaws. It is as ambitious a movie as has ever been made, and if you adjust for the era, it might also be the most lavish, expensive, and painstaking. Even today the scope and detail stand out, despite the many technical limitations in its era. Likewise, the enormous cast list contains many names that silent film fans will recognize at once, with well-known performers even in some of the minor roles. Then, you could write many pages about the stories, which are filled with weaknesses, but which are also so interesting that you never want to miss what will happen next.The concept behind ""Intolerance"" is as enterprising as it gets: no fewer than four complete, independent story-lines, with the movie switching back-and-forth among them, not necessarily in consecutive order but with a definite plan in mind, all in order to get across the idea suggested by the title - that is, that intolerance of others' beliefs or lifestyles has been a destructive force throughout history. It is generally understood that there is a strong dose of defensiveness behind this plan, since the ideas promoted in Griffith's previous film had earned for him some severe and well-justified criticism. This personal motivation could well explain why ""Intolerance"" is often so overblown, and it also is interesting in light of the stories chosen to illustrate the main themes.The two most straightforward stories - the persecution of the Huguenots in 16th century France, and the persecution of Jesus Christ by the religious leaders of his day - are also the most believable, and yet they do not seem to get quite the screen time or the lavish detail of the other two. The contemporary story may have been the most important to Griffith, and it is a full-scale melodrama, full of heavy-handed developments and very unlikely coincidences, yet certainly a story that will hold your attention. The Babylonian story is at once the strangest choice, the most extravagant, and the most fascinating of all. As history, it is as distorted as (or more so than) any of today's movies. Trying to pass off Belshazzar of Babylon as a model of justice and tolerance is just weird, and the entire historical scenario is at best an imaginative embellishment of the truth. But the involved story that Griffith tells in this setting is so exciting and entertaining that you just can't take your eyes away from it.Much, much more could be said, but anyone with an interest in silent movies or in cinema history will want to watch it and draw his or her own conclusions. Whether you want to analyze the vast array of themes, events, and ideas, or whether you just want to sit back and enjoy a fascinating spectacle, the three hours fly by very quickly, and it's a movie you won't forget."
101,1-tt0006864,Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006864/," Excellent Historical Perspective
","This silent film by director D.W. Griffith is well known to serious movie buffs and historians, but not to today's general public. I doubt that a lot of people these days would have the patience to sit through a film that contained three hours of silence. Nevertheless, the film's technical innovations inspired filmmakers in the 1920's and later, particularly in Russia and Japan. It also inspired filmmakers in the U.S., including Cecil B. DeMille and King Vidor. For this reason, and for other reasons, ""Intolerance"" is an important film.The film's four interwoven stories, set in four different historical eras, are tied together thematically by the subject of ""intolerance"", a word which could be accurately interpreted today as ""oppression"", ""injustice"", ""hate"", ""violence"", and mankind's general inhumanity.Griffith's narrative structure, though innovative, is uneven, because he gives more screen time to two of the four stories (the ""modern"" and the ""Babylonian""). Equal time for three stories, thus deleting the fourth, might have worked better.To me, the Babylonian story is the most interesting one because of its more complete coverage, and because of its elaborate costumes and spectacular sets. Even though there is no script, the viewer can easily discern the plot, which suggests that some of today's films might be just as effective, or more so, if screenwriters would downsize the dialogue.What ""Intolerance"" offers most of all to contemporary viewers is a sense of perspective. Someone once said that despite the enormous advances in technology, society itself has advanced not at all. That may be true. In the eighty plus years since the film was released, technical advances in film-making have been obvious and impressive. But we are still plagued with the same old human demons of oppression, injustice, hate, violence, and ... intolerance."
102,2-tt0006864,Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006864/," Monumental Failure
","""Intolerance"" is D.W. Griffith's apologia for ""The Birth of a Nation"" mostly in that it surpasses its predecessor's epic scale, thus replying to his critics. ""The Birth of a Nation"" was a racist film, and nothing in ""Intolerance"" proves otherwise, but I don't think that's the point, either. And, while Griffith calls his critics hypocrites, it's just as easy to call Griffith one for his racism. Yet, I have no disagreement that his films are art despite their messages. ""Intolerance"" contains much more agreeable views than ""The Birth of a Nation"", anyhow: Christian pacifism; support of labor; moderated progressivism; and condemnation of intolerance, hatred and inhumanity throughout the ages.The narrative structure of ""Intolerance"" was revolutionary and particularly surprising for a filmmaker who had cemented in cinema a traditional and theatrical form of linear storytelling with his previous work. In ""Home, Sweet Home"" (1914), Griffith linked four separate stories with a single theme, but with each story told in full before proceeding to the next. With ""Intolerance"", he employed parallel editing, thus continually crosscutting between time, suspending plots and commenting on stories with other stories, and I think it's ingeniously congruent considering the stories are supposed to run parallel in their morals, or messages on the general theme of intolerance.The four stories include a modern story, which features a fictional representation of the Ludlow massacre of strikers and a progressive era foundation of busybody reformers that indirectly causes the massacre and directly applies suffering on the central characters. It was originally intended as a complete film in itself and was later released as such under the title ""The Mother and the Law"". Then, there's the Babylonian story, which was also released by itself, as ""The Fall of Babylon"". It almost seems to be more likely to have been directed by Cecil B. DeMille than by D.W. Griffith, for all its sex and exotic set design against a historical setting. A contemporary of Griffith, however, DeMille had not yet figured out that formula and may well have been thinking of the Babylonian sequences in ""Intolerance"" when he did; one of his early pictures and first attempts at an epic, ""Joan the Woman"" (1917), does demonstrate Griffith's influence on him. Additionally, the sequence features the best performance in the film by ingénue Constance Talmadge as the ""Mountain Girl"". She, too, seems out of place in a Griffith production, with her sexuality, impropriety and independence. The lesser stories of Christ's life and his crucifixion and the events leading up to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre aren't especially interesting in themselves, as many have panned. Yet, I don't think that's essential, as they don't stand by themselves, but are part of a whole where they comment on and run parallel to each other and the other narratives.The stories are connected by explanatory, as well as moralizing and poetical, intertitles and by glimpses of Lillian Gish endlessly rocking the cradle (taken from Walt Whitman). Reportedly, tinting also separated the stories upon initial release. Nearing the climax, however, these separations and transitions evaporate for an ever more merging and rapider plot. ""Intolerance"" is the apex of Griffith's innovations and developments in editing--the culmination of his achievements in ""The Birth of a Nation"" and his last-minute-rescue pictures and other Biograph shorts. Along the way, it was usually James and Rose Smith who aided him in the editing room. Doubtless, these achievements, especially in ""Intolerance"", greatly influenced the Soviet and European montage filmmakers, as well as subsequent filmmaking in general.With the astounding success of ""The Birth of a Nation"", Griffith had the opportunity to make almost any film he wanted, and with ""Intolerance"" having cost nearly $400,000 to make, he did. (The some $100,000 budget for ""The Birth of a Nation"" had been unheard of in Hollywood.) The film's failure financially ruined Triangle Studios and considerably altered and limited Griffith's filmmaking career from thereon. As ""The Birth of a Nation"" demonstrated to Hollywood and the world how profitable and popular cinema could be, ""Intolerance"" told another important lesson on the risks and limitations involved.Consuming much of the film's budget were Walter L. Hall's Babylon sets, and they are spectacular. They're also surprisingly imaginative and elaborate for D.W. Griffith, whose stagy, open-air sets in previous productions were generally unremarkable--besides those in ""Judith of Bethulia"" (1914), which pale in comparison. The influence of ""Cabiria"" (1914) is very evident, but where that film failed to equal the brilliance of its sets with the filming of them, ""Intolerance"" succeeds. The legendary crane shots are standouts.Throughout the film, cinematographer ""Billy"" Bitzer masks the camera lens--more extensively than ever before--creating iris shots, a moving iris shot within a stationary shot and small-scale widescreen effects. Griffith and Bitzer are very much in control of the images, establishing us as spectators. The Babylonian scenes where characters look down at miniatures of the city, I think, also add to this emphasis. And, ""Intolerance"" is quite a spectacle, especially the Babylonian scenes. Overall, the cinematography, such as some extreme close-ups, is innovative and advanced. Additionally, Griffith and Bitzer once again proved themselves masters of filming battle scenes.""Cabiria"" and the other Italian epics were a great impetus for Griffith to have embarked on his own two epic masterpieces, but the Italian epics were merely super-theatrical, with ""Cabiria"" as its apex and somewhat of a bridge to Griffith making the epic a cinematic art and a cornerstone of the industry. Moreover, from his pioneering short films at Biograph, to the epics ""The Birth of a Nation"" and ""Intolerance"", and to a lesser extent, his work thereafter, nobody has had a greater influence on the course cinema would take than D.W. Griffith."
103,3-tt0006864,Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006864/," The Hand That Rocks the Cradle...
","In 1915, D.W. Griffith's gave birth to modern cinema with ""The Birth of a Nation"", a giant leap that proved the remaining skeptics that the 20th century wouldn't do without the reel, that there was a time for Chaplin's gesticulations and a time for serious storytelling. Of course, Chaplin's contribution is more valuable because he understood the universality of cinema more than any other filmmaker, let alone Griffith who made his film culminate with the glorification of the KKK. ¨People from all over the world would rather relate to the little tramp than any Griffith's character, but as I said in my ""Birth of a Nation"" review, without that seminal film, there wouldn't even be movies to contradict it.And D.W. Griffith was actually the first to do so by making a humanistic anthology named ""Intolerance: Love's Struggle Through the Ages"", a three-hour epic relating four separate stories set at different historical times, but all converging toward the same hymn to intolerance, or denunciation of intolerance's effect through four major storylines: the fall of Babylon, the crucifixion of the Christ, the Bartholomew Day massacre and a contemporary tale with odd modern resonances. The four stories overlap throughout the film, punctuated with the same leitmotif of a mother ""endless rocking the cradle"", as to suggest the timeless and universal importance of the film. The mother is played by an unrecognizable Lillian Gish but it's not exactly a film that invites you to admire acting, the project is so big, so ambitious on a simple intellectual level that it transcends every cinematic notion. It is really a unique case described as the only cinematic fugue (a word used for music), one of these films so dizzying in their grandeur that you want to focus on the achievements rather than the shortcomings, just like ""Gone With the Wind"" or more recently ""Avatar"". Each of the four stories would have been great and cinematically appealing in its own right, Griffith dares to tell the four of them using his trademark instinct for editing. Technically, it works.And while I'm not surprised that he could pull such a stunt since he had already pushed the envelope in 1915, bmaking this ""Intolerance"" only one year after ""The Birth of Nation"" is baffling, especially since it was meant as an answer to the backlash he suffered from, it's obvious it wasn't pre-planned, so how he could make this in less than a year is extraordinary. I can't imagine how he got all these extras (three thousands), the recreations of ancient Babylon, of 16th century France, and still have time for a real story, but maybe that's revealing how eager he was to show that he wasn't the bigoted monster everyone accused him of, as if the scale of his sincerity had to be measured in terms of cinematic zeal. That the film flopped can even play as a sort of redemption in Griffith's professional arc.But after the first hour, we kind of get the big picture and we understand that Griffith tells it like he means it. It works so well that the American Film Institute replaced the ""Birth of a Nation"" from the AFI Top 100 with ""Intolerance"" in the 10th anniversary update. But after watching the two of them, I believe they both belonged to the list as they're the two ideological sides of the same coin. But if one had to be kept, it would be the infamous rather than the famous, if only because the former is more 'enjoyable' in the sense that there's never a dull moment where you feel tempted to skip to another part. ""Intolerance"" had one titular key word: struggle, I struggled to get to the end, and even then, I had to watch it again because I couldn't stay focused. Indeed, what a challenging movie patience-wise!This is a real orgy of set decorations that kind of loses its appeal near the second act, and while the first modern story is interesting because you can tell Griffith wanted to highlight the hypocrisy of our world's virtue posers, who try to make up for the very troubles they cause and use money for the most lamentable schemes, it might be too demanding to plug your mind to so many different stories. And when the climax starts with its collection of outbursts of violence, I felt grateful for finally rewarding my patience than enjoying the thrills themselves, especially since it doesn't hold up as well as the climactic sequence of ""The Birth of a Nation"". Or maybe we lost the attention span when it comes to silent movies, but there must be a reason the film flopped even at its time, maybe the abundance of notes and cardboards that makes the film look like a literary more than visual experience?I guess ""Intolerance"" can be enjoyed sequence by sequence, by making as many halts as possible in that epic journey, but it's difficult to render a negative judgment for such a heavy loaded film. For my part, I'm glad I could finally watch and review all the movies from the American Film Institute's Top 100 and I appreciate its personal aspect in Griffith's career. Perhaps what the film does the best is to say more about the man than the director. His insistence on never giving names to his characters (""The Boy"", ""The Dear Guy""...) calling a mobster a ""Musketeer"" and all that vocabulary reveal his traditional and sentimental view of America, and maybe the rest of the world. That's might be Griffith's more ironic trait, so modern on the field of technical film-making yet so old-fashioned in his vision, he's one hell of a storyteller and he handles the universal and historical approach of his film like a master, but when it comes to his personal vision, he struck me as the illustration of his own metaphor, like a good mother-figure endlessly rocking our cradle."

","This mammoth production and DW Griffith's 1916 masterpiece was his followup to The Birth of a Nation. Intolerance blends 4 stories of historical intolerance as a warning against the current-day evils of war. The French and Judean stories are OK. The Babylonian and Modern stories are spectacular. Where Griffith experimented with closeups and intercutting stories in Birth of a Nation, these techniques are mastered in Intolerance. Griffith also continues his incredible eye for composition and scenery and costumes in this epic film.The sets and costumes for the Babylonian story are among the best in film history. And the battle scenes equal anything in Birth of a Nation. Griffith's Babylonian set is so huge it allows for horse-drawn chariots to ride side by side on the road at the top of the towering walls. The camera shot that shows the chariots and the battle many stories below is astounding. There is also the famous camera shot that slowly moves closer and closer the the city steps and gates where hundreds of dancers perform a pagan production number. Just amazing.The emotional oomph of this film comes from the modern story where a young couple living in a tenement apartment almost gets destroyed by society do-gooders. The intercutting of scenes here is masterful as the rescuers race to save the hero who is about to be hanged. Melodrama to be sure, but in a form never seen before 1916.And as usual Griffith assembles a terrific cast and elicits great performances from many of them.Constance Talmadge plays the cinema's first feminist heroine as the Mountain Girl in the Babylonian story. She's wonderful as the saucy girl who eats onions while on the block to be sold as a slave. As the men come near to examine her (she's dressed in a pelt) she shakes her onions at them and kicks at them. Hilarious. The story is complicated but she overhears a plot to attack the city and the ruler (who set her free) she adores. Great scenes of Talmadge racing a chariot through the desert. Great battle scenes that are unforgettable. Great orgy scenes. This is just a wonderful story that is so eye-filling, you have to watch it several times to take everything in.The modern story boasts a perfect performance by Mae Marsh as the ""Dear One."" Robert Harron is the husband, and Miriam Cooper (very underrated) is the ""bad girl."" One of the most harrowing scenes I can remember is when the ""do-gooders"" (headed by Vera Lewis) come to take Marsh's baby after Harron is falsely arrest for murder. Marsh is so realistic in this frenzied scene that your heart just stops. Harron is also excellent as the hapless boy who gets framed for murder. The editing of this arc of the film sets the standard for decades to come.Intolerance must be seen by any serious film buff. It's a long film but is unforgettable. The cast list is impressive and includes the above-mentioned Constance Talmadge, Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Miriam Cooper, Lillian Gish, Vera Lewis, Ralph Lewis, Douglas Fairbanks, Bessie Love, Wallace Reid, Elmo Lincoln, Elmer Clifton, Mary Alden, Constance Collier, Carmel Myers, Erich von Stroheim, Donald Crisp, Carol Dempster, Marguerite Marsh, Tully Marshall, Natalie Talmadge, Alma Rubens, Seena Owen, Margery Wilson, Eugene Palette, Ethel Grey Terry, Owen Moore, Alfred Paget, Joseph Henabery, Josephine Crowell, Ruth St. Denis, Ted Shawn, Mildred Harris, Walter Long, Sam De Grasse, Monte Blue, Kate Bruce, Nigel De Brulier, Pauline Starke, Lillian Langdon, and future directors King Vidor, Frank Borzage, and Tod Browning!"

","It's very hard to review INTOLERANCE today, as the film is so old fashioned that even comparing it to films made just a decade later is a problem. When it debuted in 1916, it was a technical masterpiece due to D. W. Griffith's insane spending habits--with the millions he sank into the film with these extraordinary sets, it couldn't help but knock the socks off the audience. The film featured live elephants (plus a few papier mache ones that were well camouflaged), thousands of extras and sets that even by today's standards are amazing. The huge walls of Babylon and the enormous statues are NOT matte paintings but were actually built for this amazing film. The problem, though, is that although people DID come to see the film, they never came in large enough numbers to recoup production costs and it was a huge box office failure. I think part of this might have been because while the film was beautiful to look at, the narrative was very confused (being made up of four separate films inter-spliced together) as well as extremely preachy AND sexy (now THAT's a unique combination).A lot of these problems could have been avoided by simply making four separate films--or at least filming one or two of the best sequences only. Plus, two of the sequences (the story of Jesus and the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre) seemed too choppy and incomplete--like they were more afterthoughts of Griffith. The two remaining sequences, the Babylonian and the one set in 1916 had much more merit. While the Babylonian one was pretty silly in many ways, it was by far the most visually appealing and just overwhelms the viewer. The 1916 sequence had simple contemporary sets and had an excellent story that paralleled the stingy Puritanism of John D. Rockefeller--and this alone would have made an excellent film. But when all the films were combined with their tenuous and schmaltzy message, the overall picture really bogged down and is almost laughably bad in spots. What I particularly found interesting were scenes with Jesus appearing along with some very, very risqué scenes of practically naked dancing girls from Babylon! What this film DESPERATELY needed was a producer--not D. W. Griffith tossing in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink into an overblown mega-picture that couldn't help but fail."

","""Intolerance"" (Wark Producing Corporation, 1916), directed by D.W. Griffith, became an immediate follow-up to the director's previous effort, a civil war story titled ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915), using many of the same actors including Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Miriam Cooper, among others. Of the two, I find ""Intolerance"" the most interesting, mainly because of its advance style in story telling. Yet, ""Intolerance"" did not become as successful nor controversial as ""The Birth of a Nation"" when first released.""Intolerance"" consists of four separate stories into one movie, but what's unusual about it is that the stories are not told episodically, but presented simultaneously in parallel action, linked together with Lillian Gish as the mother rocking her cradle. The stories consist of THE MODERN STORY, THE JUDEAN STORY, THE FRENCH STORY and finally THE BABYLONIAN STORY. Of the four, only THE JUDEAN STORY is the shortest and less detailed, featuring the life of Jesus Christ, as played by Howard Gaye. THE MODERN STORY, starring Mae Marsh and Robert Harron, finds the young couple getting married, followed by the husband resorting to life of crime when unable to find work, and later accused of a murder he did not commit; THE FRENCH STORY is set during the Middle Ages with Brown Eyes (Margery Wilson) and Prosper Latour (Eugene Palette) of religious intolerance under the regime of Catherine De Medici (Josephine Crowell); and THE BABYLONIAN STORY finds the Mountain Girl (Constance Talmadge) treated kindly by Belshazzar (Alfred Paget) when she is forced by the judicial system to appear on the marriage market, and falls in love with her prince. The battle scenes in this segment are well staged, considering the time of when this movie was produced. The Belshazzar's Banquet Hall set is the most famous sequence of all, shown many times as a film clip segment in several documentaries about silent films. The sets are lavish and the expense of this production shows. In spite of some hokey acting and title cards, which was taken seriously by 1916 standards, it's still a worthy viewing, especially for film scholars. Of all the actors who have appeared in this production, and there are too many to mention, the one who's most remembered long after the film is over is the one with less footage, Lillian Gish.""Intolerance"" is available on video in several different versions. Besides public domain videos with bad copies and no music score whatsoever, the three noted mentions include, (1) The former Blackhawk Video Company distributed it in the 1980s at 135 minutes accompanied with clear picture, an organ score and intermission. The opening titles of that print claims it to be the most complete copy, which includes the list of cast actors and their roles. (2) When Blackhawk merged with Republic Video several years later, it presented another copy, a shorter but almost clearer print running at 121 minutes accompanied with a good piano score and tinted picture, but minus the listing of the cast of actors and their roles. This was the copy used for the Public Television presentation of ""The Silent Years"" (1971), as hosted by Orson Welles. (3) Then there is another video copy, compliments of Kino Video, which runs at silent accu-speed, making it as long as three hours, color tints, accompanied with organ score, this version which can be seen on Turner Classic Movies. With several video copies currently available, it would certainly make a difference as to which one would make watching this movie enjoyable. On a personal level, I'd recommend No. 2, the Republic Video copy with the piano score. ""Intolerance"" can almost be said to be the first all-star movie production. But for what it's worth, this epic should rank as one of the greatest of all silent films. It's amazing that it wasn't named as one of the 100 Greatest American Movies of the twentieth century by the American Film Institute. Maybe a proposed TV special on the selection of 100 Greatest Silent Movies of All Time will amend that (****)"

","My primary interest in this was as a foundation of cinema; so an academic interest, but - having influenced so many things I am very keen on - not without some excitement at the prospect of discovery of this early common source.So much of cinema flows out from this; a host of recognizable names tutored on set - Von Stroheim, Tod Browning, Woody Van Dyke, Victor Fleming, Elmer Clifton, Jack Conway, King Vidor - and even more once the film rippled across the world. In Moscow, it was the raw material film students were given to dismantle in Lev Kuleshov's fledgling film school, the first ever. And in France Abel Gance must have been awe-struck by the sheer size of the canvas, if his own films offer any clue. So yes, a fast-paced, lavish blockbuster - it cost at the time an unprecedented $2m to make - with literally a cast of thousands animating history, the story of Hollywood excess begins here - in Italy it had started earlier, with their Roman spectacles. The filmmaker as god, who does not simply photograph reality but constructs entire worlds, permits our vision to travel in the places that we could earlier only imagine.But the fundamental technique is still from the theatre; that means a grand stage - elevated from us, separate - with every now and then a different backdrop, actors who pantomime sweeping emotion, the eye usually fixed in a distance. Oh the camera moves, but it moves with the stage. And what a grand stage it is.I suppose it must have been desirable at the time when cinema, and so the possibilities of seeing, made the world feel so new and perhaps so alive again, when so many of the trials and heroism of the world narrative were yet to be immortalized in this new way, that a film like this should try to encompass so much; the Crucifixion, medieval France, ancient Babylon, they're all urgently envisioned in the same space. It is in more ways than one that Griffith wrote the history of cinema then; by pioneering what he did in terms of a film language, but also by creating a vast expanse - a daunting 3 hours of film - that fills the prehistoric void, in terms of cinema, with a cachet of images, that creates a history of images. Now with the Pharisees or at the Persian camp of Cyrus, the court of Catherine or the harems of Babylon, common streets old and new; now we could point back and see, in a small measure, a history of film gathered in one place. So, when Kuleshov had tasked his students to rework the film, the choice was wise. There is so much here in terms of images, and so fertile for remodeling, that essentially he was presenting them with the empty sheet to write music on - that music, a deeply modernist product of synthesis, we called montage.What does this filmmaker - as god - see though, what kind of worldview does he spring into life, this is more interesting I believe. The title summarizes well. So, a cruel - but institutionalized, thus state sanctioned - evil threatening to engulf and dissolve all that is kind, which is the individual life, and of course the warm sentimentality that eventually restores faith in the personal struggle. But nothing casts a shadow in this world, no depth or dimension beyond the plainly conceivable. So the people are straight-forward beings, either good or bad - our heroine is simply called The Dear One - or misguided at their most complex; or, when en masse, they are part of the decor, collectively writhing in some extravagant background. By the end, a heavenly chorus of angels illuminate the sky above a battlefield. The immediate contrast, like so much in the film, disarms with how much painstaking vision must have gone into making something so splendorous yet so naive. We can pretend like we ought to make amends with the time it was made, just like we can't pretend to look away with indifference, but the point remains; far more complex works of art had been made before, far less didactic about their humanitarian values.You should at least see the segment with the siege of Babylon though, and the final scenes cross-cutting across time and space as we rush to the climax; it's things like these that so much was founded on.(And another image that I recommend to those of you who have been charting all this; it is an inexplicable, tight close-up of the girl who is almost brushing, breathing into the camera. It happens once, and suggests intimacy that is never again encountered in the film. It's as though the girl, and so this cinema, is yearning to cross over into a new kind of film where faces hold all the mysteries and performances visualize innermost soul. Jean Epstein would make those films, ushering us in a new perception)"

","In accordance with 'The Heritage Illustrated Dictionary of the English Language  International Edition', intolerance means '(1) the quality or condition of being intolerant.; (2) inability to withstand or consume. D.W. Griffith, the creator of the cinematographic narrative, extends this definition, presenting a masterpiece along four marks in human history. The first one is the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Then, the fall of Babylon, though the betrayal of the high priests to the King Belshazzar and his beloved princess and the conquest of the city (presently Iraq) by Cyrus. This set was the largest ever built in Hollywood. The massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve, in France is the third story. And a contemporary drama in 1916, with the story of the Dear One and The Boy and his involvement with The Musketeer's of the Slums, showing the fight between classes in the beginning of the Twentieth Century. In the end, a beautiful message of peace. The VHS copy I watched was restored and presents the music composed and conducted by Carl Davis and The Live Cinema Orchestra. An outstanding movie, recommended to those viewers who love cinema as art and mandatory for any collector. My vote is ten."

","DW Griffith did a fair share of fine work, feature and short films. Has everything that he has done been great? No. Saw 'The Birth of a Nation' recently, and while appreciating its importance and finding it extremely well made and acted the second part is so massively flawed and one can see why it's always been deemed offensive. 'Orphans of the Storm' and the best of his 1910s short films (i.e. 'The Mothering Heart') are fine examples of how great he can be.Likewise with one of his most ambitious films, 1916's 'Intolerance'. It is a long film and sprawling, but the very meaning of a truly epic achievement in pretty much every sense. One of his best and one of the best silent films ever in my view, and there are many brilliant ones out there. Don't let the massive length put you off from seeing 'Intolerance', it wasn't a problem for me being used to seeing films with long lengths and it left me utterly transfixed in a way that not many recently seen films have as much.'Intolerance' looks incredible, widely considered a visual and technical achievement and no wonder. The cinematography is not only amazing but the techniques and how they're used were revolutionary at the time and still maintains that quality. Even more striking are the huge and expensive-looking sets, the Babylonian sets have a spectacular grandeur, haven't seen sets this jaw-dropping for any film in a long time.Griffith's direction is masterly and some of his most ambitious without trying to do too much. Carl Davis' score is one of the finest examples of all the films seen recently to have music that gelled so seamlessly to the mood and enhanced it even, also a perfect marriage of visuals and music in a way not seen since my viewing of Abel Gance's 'Napoleon'. It is also a fine score in its own right.The story structurally was unique back then and over a century on it's still a contender for the best use of the multiple story/timeline structure on film. A rare example of all the stories working to some degree and where sprawling is still hugely transfixing and always coherent, also found many scenes emotionally powerful. It is at its best in the poignant modern day story and especially the Babylonian one, still astounding and really stirs the soul and emotions. The film is at its weakest with the slightly underdeveloped final days of Jesus story, but that is my one small complaint and that still manages to be intriguing and incredibly well made, directed and acted.All the acting is great, notably from Mae Marsh and Contance Talmadge.Concluding, far from intolerable. Instead, it's incredible film-making and an incredible film overall. 10/10"

","""The Ulysses Of Film""
~Dave Kehr""One of three most influential films and I think it is the best.""
~Pauline KaelJudging from these two quotes by highly respected film critics, there is no question that 'Intolerance' is one if the greats of cinema. You don't have to like it, but you will be impressed.Fresh off his first blockbuster, 'The Birth Of a Nation,' Hollywood's creator-DW Griffith-wanted to make a movie more to people's liking and understanding in a bid to show that he his not a racist. 'Birth Of a Nation' May be over a hundred years old, but it remains a very shocking and unethical film. That is why I have a softer spot Griffith's next epic.As far as I know, 'Intolerance' was the first film to use a bunch of different stories at once. This uses four from different time periods-a modern story about workers and unions; a story in Babylon; what led to St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre; and Jesus' crucifixion. Each of these deal with one underlying theme (the movie's title) that leads to the tragedy. Cut between them are transitions of a mother rocking her baby in a cradle.Despite being made over one hundred years ago and countless technological upgrades since, 'Intolerance' is still a visually stunning film. For something being done in 1916, these HEAVILY elaborate sets (the Babylon having the best and most memorable sets) had to be made by hand. Mattes were too weak at the time and CGI didn't exist, so what you saw was real. The authenticity makes the sets extra appealing.Obviously this is not a perfect film. The Jesus story should have ended better, which is one flaw. Another flaw, which some may find to be a strength, is that the two main stories (the modern and the Babylon stories) go by too fast. I totally hate slow films, but I never thought I would see something where the stories are too fast. I simply couldn't keep up. If this was a sound film, maybe using an extra sense would have made me digest the stories easier. But I plan on seeing this more. It deserves all the recognition it gets as cinema's first great film.3.5/4"

","I first saw this picture as a teenager some thirty years ago. I had no idea what to expect; all I knew was the famous still of Belshazzar's feast which has become one of the best known icons depicting the extravagance of crazy old Hollywood. But I was astounded and bowled over by what I saw. I will make no attempt at a plot synopsis here, since several other reviewers on this site have done so. Most readers already know that Griffith set out to tell four separate stories, laid in four widely spaced historical periods, and that he intercut freely between them, increasing the tempo as the film proceeded, and attempted to bring all four to a climax simultaneously. Clearly he bit off more than he, or anybody, could chew; but the fact that the limits of what cinema could do were being pushed so hard so early is what fascinated me then, and still fascinates me now. I wish to heaven that college film courses would just blow off ""Birth of a Nation"" and consign it to the oblivion it largely deserves, and show ""Intolerance"" instead, for this indeed is Griffith's monument, despite its poor state of repair; and at the risk of being technical I would like to address this. I have noticed that the one negative comment running most consistently through the reviews posted on this website is the relative lack of weight given to the French and Judaean sequences relative to the Modern and Babylonian narratives. This is largely the fault of the movie's checkered preservation history. When ""Intolerance"" failed to make huge sums at the box office, Griffith released the Babylonian and Modern stories as individual features in 1919, reshooting some scenes along the way. He cut up the original negative (gasp!) to do this, and by the time he decided to reassemble the whole movie in 1926, it turned out that all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't quite put Humpty Dumpty back together again. There was never a shooting script, or a written continuity; Griffith kept the whole thing in his head, and moreover could never stop tinkering with it while it was in release! Consequently, while the Babylonian and Modern stories have survived largely intact, the French and Judaean episodes were depleted by about half. So when we see it now we must recognize that we are viewing a broken sculpture. The movie is a restorer's nightmare; almost a third of its 2000- plus shots exist in variant versions, and the captions were rewritten more than once. But, broken as it is, it's still magnificent. There has never been, and will never again be, anything like it. It has all of Griffith's inconsistencies: subtle and naturalistic acting from Mae Marsh and Robert Harron as the luckless couple in the Modern Story are seen cheek by jowl with outrageous mugging by Walter Long as the Musketeer of the Slums, or Josephine Crowell's Catherine de Medici in France; but no masterpiece on this scale is ever consistent, after all. I love Connie Talmadge's Mountain Girl from Babylon; smart, funny and crazy. Other favorites: Tully Marshall as the villainous Priest of Bel; Seena Owen as the Princess beloved, my personal nomination for Most Fabulous Body of the Hollywood 1910s, never mind the deranged costumes; Alfred Paget as a genuinely humane Belshazzar; Howard Gaye as a believable and totally unforced Jesus. Everything the silent screen of 1916 could do, good, bad, subtle, overblown, crazy or glorious is embodied here; and Griffith never rode so high again. The most satisfactory version currently available, in my opinion, is the Kino on Video edition on vhs and dvd, the one illustrated when you first call the picture up on this site. There are some problems and a few missing bits that I take exception to, but overall this is the version that first time viewers should try."

","""Intolerance"" may in fact be the first truly great movie ever created. Some would say that honor goes to ""Birth Of A Nation"". Unfortunately, it's now regarded as old shame as it's quite racist. As I have now seen both films, I will admit that this one is better. Seeing as how it was made so quickly after BOAN, I thought it would be against racism. It's true that intolerance is obviously the main theme, but it isn't racism that this touches upon. It's a variety of things, but mostly religious tolerance. Nowadays, everyone just hates every kind of religion so it's quite unique.The weirdest part was figuring out where the ""modern"" part took place. It looked like it could easily pass for the 1950's. I realized it obviously couldn't be at that time because it hadn't happened yet. I guess it works really well as a period piece. It's hard to say that was unintentional, seeing as how it shows years from so long ago. What I love is that these years are so far apart. I'm no mathematician, but he fact that they seem to be equally distant, at least in terms of technology, shows great variety. My favorite is the Babylon part.Of course, most people say that. It's obviously the parts that have the best battle scene with really does hold up. I felt like I was watching an old timey version of ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"". This is about as epic as it comes back in those days. I also love the way the stories are told. They're mostly separated by a literal story book. The actors are even credited differently based on the segments they're in. I guess it's hard to find the fullest version, but three hours is long enough for me. At the end, they simply show all the different parts together. It does all add up well. This is one of the best silent films, well, one of the best films ever made and everyone should see it and yes, it has a great message of prejudice that holds true now and forever. Perfect ****."

","I put off seeing ""Intolerance"" for years, fearing that the bloated, silent epic would be more of a punishment than a reward. I was surprised by how intelligent and spectacular a movie it was. The parallels between the ages ancient, present, and in between are fascinating, and it's a shame to think that no filmmaker since 1916 has attempted a historical, epic, poem so grand. It would be easy to dismiss parts of the film, but that would be treason to its creator. It is a comment on the eternal struggle of goodness against it's adversary intolerance, a message to the future that we will never evolve without admitting this. Ninety years later,it seems that we haven't come that far, if we've made any progress at all. Some of the sights are remarkable: Babylon, the heavenly final sequence, the worker's strike, Christ, chariots...

The battle sequences are so exciting and suspenseful that it's hard not to love their intensity and well crafted nature.""Intolerance"" doesn't follow one simple narrative, but four narratives, each narrative from a separate time period, from the Babylonian era to modern day America. Instead of, more conventionally, presenting each story one at a time, D.W. Griffith cuts from one story/time period to another in an extremely influential way. It's clear that this makes the film horribly complicated for a 1916 audience. Heck, today the film still is pretty complicated!Many people may say that the film is a bit melodramatic or-*GASP*-dated, but, to be honest, it's a film made 100 years ago! And, even if it is a bit corny at times today, there still is a lot of stuff in ""Intolerance"" that is still truly emotional and gripping to this very day.If you hate ""The Birth of a Nation"", you still may love ""Intolerance"". It has the technical mastery of ""The Birth of a Nation"", but without the blatant and repulsive racism.

Griffith made ""Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages"" to prove to everyone that he was not a hate-filled ideologue (although it would've been more effective had he also addressed racism). As it stands, the movie does a fine job denouncing various instances of horror unleashed by hatred and injustice.The movie is a little awkward with the storylines broken up. I suppose that Griffith did that to show the similarities between, say, the destruction of Babylon and the massacre of the Huguenots.

","If watching Birth of a Nation could be likened to ordering soup at a restaurant, appreciating the fine china bowl it's contained in but nevertheless sending it back because it lacked any warmth, D.W. Giffith's so-called ""apologetic"" follow-up is akin to the waiter coming back with something far more appetising. Often hailed as a film ""you must see once"", Intolerance I argue is a film you should not only see once, and from a reputable source (I cannot recommend the blu-ray highly enough, most of all for the wonderful presentation of Carl Davis' rigorous 1989 score) but also then treasure for the rest of your movie-watching days. Telling four simultaneous stories that interlock with a despairing narrative throughout, the film cuts back and forth with tension, action, suspense and spectacle like nothing that had been seen before. Yes, more-so even than the much more widely lauded Birth of a Nation. The weakest and most superfluous of the stories, featuring the rise and fall of Jesus of Nazareth, is tepid and never really gets going. You get the sense that Griffith merely wanted a biblical bow to tie around the trimmings of his movie to give it extra moralist oomph. While he never quite succeeds in doing so, the segments are thankfully given very little screen time for us to really get frustrated over. The second of the bunch, a French Renaissance piece revolving around the lead up to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, has its moments, but again mostly plays second fiddle to the larger plays at hand. The two centrepiece stories set in modern 1916 and Babylonian 539BC are where the film's real meat resides and exist to showcase the film's dualism in starkly contrasting two completely different eras of mankind's history which are plagued by all-too-familiar human flaws. Contrasting the huge sets of Babylonia with the small, claustrophobic rooms of modern 1916 whilst effectively telling the same story on different scales, Griffith strikes a firm balance between raw emotional storytelling and thrilling ideological battles fought with religion, money, power and morality. And while the two least interesting stories never really amount to anything revelatory on their own, in employing the same cross-cutting seen in Birth of a Nation's climactic sequences, Intolerance comes to a gripping and cohesive conclusion ripe with pathos and stark imagery thanks to their intricately interwoven nature.While reports of Intolerance being Griffith's act of atonement for his previous effort are often regarded as folly, regardless there exists a warmth to it that was absent in Nation. Grander, more outward-looking in terms of scale and ideology, and most importantly presented with an artistry that propels the work further and with more lasting, readily- appreciated value. From the epic sets and casts of extras sprawling around each other in death and dance, to the smallest, most intricate moments of sorrow and inner-turmoil, Intolerance is not only the first truly great film in cinematic history, but to this day remains as a rare example of film existing as a form of classically-tuned art. Art with a pulse, a heart and a desire. See it once, sure, but I guarantee you'll be back for one more rock of the cradle."

It could have been done in half the time with only two of the stories. My guess is that Griffith wanted to do some historical dramas and decided to cram them all into one movie. His making of the Babylon set has become a Hollywood legend.The film is well-done, extremely well-acted and the battle scenes are still strong stuff--bloody and violent.

","The most remarkable thing about Intolerance while I was watching it was that I found myself engaging with it as I would a modern piece of movie-making. Sometimes, even often times, when watching silence cinema I try to take it on the context of when it was made: that the director and crew and actors were working back when storytelling was completely new with moving images, that the scenarios were a little rougher, and that the social mores and other things made it specific to that time and place. Or, to put it another way, at times it might be dated as far as the storytelling - in the worst case scenarios, in a word, creaky.Intolerance begins in the first half hour sort of un-loading its four different scenarios - stories set in the modern day (of 1916) around the world of a company Jenkins and a feminist group; the Babylonians and Persians and their battles and quests for glory; the 16th century with turmoil in France; and the story of Jesus in Nazareth - but once the stories get going, Griffith's editing and storytelling work more like how one might see in a movie today. To say he was sophisticated in advancing the art of filmmaking is an understatement.This does not necessarily mean that there aren't things about it that haven't dated; there are some beats that come off as sexist (one of the inter-titles actually says, ""when women are no longer able to attract men they turn to reform as a second option,"" in the modern times story) and there are some points where Griffith ratchets up the melodrama so high that it becomes sort of hysterical. But that's something I just take as a given with his approach, and to be fair this isn't quite as hyper-WTF as Birth of a Nation... then again, what is? And what Griffith is after here is nothing short of creating storytelling as a kind of visual symphony, particularly in the last like 45 to 50 minutes as all of the stories reach their manic and highly dramatic climaxes all at one - all while that woman sitting by the crib (is that Lillian Gish, how about that) is there sort of like the unofficial God(dess) of these slices of the human condition.There's a lot that can be dissected here, but I think what's telling, and what may actually be a slight (but only a slight) detriment to the filmmaking, is how much Griffith clearly prefers to tell more of two of the four stories: the modern day story and the Babylon epic. He gets to stage what I imagine were, with not much to compare to at the time (maybe aside from, uh, himself with BOTN and maybe Cabiria), the most spectacular battles recorded on film, and to bring together this story of ""The Dear One"" (Mae Marsh, gosh she's delightful and so ready to go full throttle with her acting) in a way that shows a sort of culmination of the melodramas he'd been making for years at Biograph. I didn't keep count of the minutes, but I'm pretty sure that these two tales - and by the way, the Babylon story also features a force of f***ing nature with Constance Talmadge as 'The Mountain Girl' - outnumber the French/Hugenot and Christ segments by quite a lot, and for the latter it almost seemed as if that was more allegorical to what was going on anyway in the other stories, especially the Boy's plight.I wouldn't say those should've been cut down or taken out, despite the Babylon and modern time stories being stronger overall; it's more a question of pacing. A recent descendant of Intolerance's approach to multi-level storytelling is Cloud Atlas (and I'm sure Nolan is a fan of this as well, not a doubt in my mind), and while that film certain is more scattered and messy in the success of its segments, the pacing was actually an improvement at times as far as balancing all of the stories. But, again, this almost in an ironic way a compliment to Griffith, that I think of this epic in such a way that it's closer to what movies in the 21st century achieve as far as bringing a novelistic approach 100 years on. So while I might have wanted more of those stories in France and Nazareth, what I got was still very good.I think the quality of Griffith's direction is what makes this so strong, along with some of the key performances and how he simply mounted such massive sets that, in their way, are more impressive than what you get today in CGI; your mind knows that all those figures are fake in modern films, no matter how much detail is put in here. In Intolerance, when I look at the people all in that Babylonian decadence, and then when the battle breaks out against the mighty Cyrus, it *feels* intense and sprawling.Unlike Birth of a Nation, which has such an unpleasant and virulent 2nd half that makes me never want to see it again on principle alone, I could find myself coming back to Intolerance, perhaps getting into it a little quicker than I found on a first time (that first half hour takes a little time as I mentioned), and just to marvel at some of the acting which is both big AND small in equal measure. By this I should say that you can't help but see when actors really are milking the emotion for all its worth - Brown Eyes in the French scenes, or that female killer in the modern day story, where Griffith really gets to use his close-ups in such a way that must have changed movies forever - but there's subtlety when called for also. The more I think about it hours after watching it, the more it feels like a monumental (if imperfect) achievement. 9.5/10"

","Only CITIZEN KANE and 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY come close to the kind of originality in Griffith's silent masterpiece. All three were financial failures, unpopular when first released - even though they've acquired legendary status as the decades passed. They are the cinematic equivalents of novels like ULYSSES and MOBY-DICK, whose complexity and strangeness make them almost unreachable to the average reader. This is what happens when artists break into uncharted territory: they risk everything with such achievements - even their reputations.
So, what we have here is a movie that for about 2 and a half hours juggles 4 different story lines that illustrate intolerance throughout history: religious warfare in Ancient Babylon; the story of Jesus from scripture; the persecution of the French Huguenots; and injustice in Twentieth Century America. Throughout this wild ride of a movie we sense we are in the hands of a brilliant film-maker using every bit of his resources to entertain and enthrall us. It is too, probably, simply showing off. There will always be those who cannot tolerate the shock of experiencing something new - poor things. One hundred years later Intolerance is as unique and new as it was the day it was made."

","Intolerance (1916) :
Brief Review -An Immortal Masterpiece. There's nothing in the entire vocabulary of Cinema world that hasn't been influenced by this. These are Orson Welles's lines about this film and i liked it so kept it. He also said one more interesting thing that, ""Intolerance is way too complex for 1916 audience and it is still a very complex for today's audience"". I agree. I am 28, have watched 1000+ Classic films made all over the World. I am done with all those complex stories told by Stanley Kubrick and current time sensation Christopher Nolan and then this 104 years old film comes, i start watching it and don't understand what the hell is going on. It took me almost an hour to understand the ongoings and characters of those parallel stories. Like Welles said, Intolerance has every single element of cinema like drama, romance, betrayal, history, devotion, tragedy, war and bla bla you name it and you find it right here. One of best line said by Welles was about getting the credit. You see, there are many classic films made in silent era and then talkies took influences from them so the credibility of those talkies was not there. Because every classic film of talkies era has been influenced by some film made way before it but Intolerance was made when there were no influeneces available. Hence, the credibility sticks to it, you can't just take it away. And like I said it has all the elements of cinema that means it has left influences for so many genre discovered after 1930s. Intolerance is not about one man or one time period, it tells four stories set in four different centuries, simultaneously. This intercut idea is brilliant because you stay with all four storyline at the same time as all of them run together, no one is left behind nor is kept ahead. The begining and ending of all four stories doesn't take place at different time, it all ends together. I don't remember any film being so clever in storytelling especially those having multiple storylines. Intolerance is undoubtedly the Greatest Storytelling I've ever seen in Hollywood. Apart from storytelling it has got huge scale and grandeur which is also without any doubt among the Biggest Cinematic Experiences ever. Perhaps, the Biggest Ever and not one of the biggest. I mean this grandeur was made in 1916, seriously how big it was for that time. And it was made without any VFX work, right? Then it's certainly BIGGEST EVER! I never imagined that watching great films from silent era, especially before 1920 would make me feel pity on talkies. This is my 3rd film from 1920s and I'm expecting more surprises as i continue watching more films from the same decade. Overall, Intolerance is an immortal masterpiece, the greatest storytelling in the format, poineer of almost all cinematic elements and the grandeur ahead by a century.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest"

","Four strands here, sometimes merging (as in the final sequences where all the stories come together), sometimes standing alone.  The 'Modern' and Babylonian stories are the most striking, with Mae Marsh, Miriam Cooper and Bobby Harron shining in the 'Modern' segment, and Constance Talmadge dominating ancient Babylon as the Mountain Girl.  The St Bartholomew massacre is well depicted in its section(s) with an absorbing story, while the time of Christ gives Howard Gaye a chance to put his Messiah on record. 
How does it stand as a film after more than 80 years have gone by?  It is very long and in places very ponderous, but as an example of early features it stands alongside Birth of a Nation, Civilisation, and Joan the Woman amongst its contemporaries, and shows a brave attempt to do something new with cinema.  For that alone it deserves its place in history.  As an entertainment in itself, I wanted to see the whole thing again immediately after I saw it, and still find something new to marvel at on repeat viewings.  Wonderful."

","Although the messenger is a product of the 19th century, D.W. Griffith's film techniques developed in Birth Of A Nation and Intolerance have certainly stood the test of time. In four separate stories Griffith brought home a very simple message, why doesn't everyone just leave everyone else alone? I for one agree with that completely, he was talking about diversity to use a term currently in vogue.Having concurrent story lines is now an accepted technique of film making and fans who've enjoyed such modern work as The Godfather Part II, The Hours, and American Graffiti, II can thank D.W. Griffith for pioneering this in Intolerance.Some stories are a bit stronger than others and all of them could have been motion pictures on their own. Some like the Judean story which has been a film on its own several times over. The way Griffith tells it is directly and simply not anything like the blockbuster spectacles King Of Kings both versions or The Greatest Story Ever Told. The character of Jesus going to the cross for spreading some radical new ideas about loving one another is the universal standard that the rest of the audience could immediately identify with and draw the inferences from the other three stories.If Intolerence is mentioned today the first thing that usually comes to mind is the Babylonian story. Some biblical scholars will come down on me for this, but I think Griffith said there was a lot in common with the Christian message and the Babylonian story of live and let live. According to Griffith though the Babylonians gave way from liberty to just plain license and had not the real will to defend their civilization. When one set of pagans won't tolerate the worship of another pagan deity and they're willing to force the issue, Babylon is doomed. Still those sets are positively awesome and you can see the influence D.W. Griffith had on Cecil B. DeMille.By the way when I say pagan it's not a pejorative term just people who follow older religious traditions than the dominant Abrahamic monotheist religions that pushed the others out sooner or later.Nobody's living and let living in France in 1575 either. This story revolves around a French Huguenot family who is prosperous and the daughter is being courted by an open minded individual. But this is the century of the Reformation and the Catholic Church is as much a political entity as a faith. For this and the next century Europe is torn apart as religion is added to the geopolitical components already there. The ruling House of Valois in France has no problems aligning with the Ottoman Turks in foreign policy, but Protestants at home is another matter. Queen mother Catherine De Medici orders a general massacre of known Protestants and her puppet son King, Charles IX always does as mother says. The result is the infamous St. Bartholomew massacre. And remember everyone here says they are following the teachings of the protagonist of the Judean story.Finally we have a modern (1916) story where two young working class people are torn apart by the meddling of self proclaimed moralizers. The small town where the two protagonists come from is a one company town where the local mill owner won't pay a living wage, but will fund his spinster daughter's obsession with the moral welfare of all the people that are in the town. Their group the Uplifters is the root cause of everyone's problems.There are some memorable performances in all the stories. Howard Gaye is a simple and stoic Jesus enduring all the mockery of the Pharisees for his universal message. In the Babylonian story Constance Talmadge who becomes an unwitting pawn in the religious intrigue as does Elmer Clifton who is kind of a pagan evangelist if that's not a mixed metaphor will not be forgotten easily. Talmadge heavily made up and under pseudonym is also seen as the haughty and fanatical Catherine DeMedici in the French story and I can hardly believe a slim and trim Eugene Palette as the young lover. Hard to believe he's the same guy 20 years later who is the harassed father of Carole Lombard and Gail Patrick in My Man Godfrey. And in the modern story Mae Marsh and Robert Herron as a Romeo and Juliet like young couple will linger with you as will Vera Lewis the young rich daughter head of the Uplifters and a repressed lesbian if I ever saw one. Those Uplifters were something else, during the sound era you could see them again in such films like Dodge City with the Pure Prarie League and Lee Remick's temperance followers in The Hallelujah Trail.Griffith's device for connecting the story was the universal symbol of motherhood as portrayed by Lillian Gish, his favorite player. She's innocence personified as you see her rocking the cradle of mankind and hoping the next generation of kids gets it right.Intolerance is a film still dissected and analyzed, it's structure makes it impossible to resist. It may be arcane, but in some instances its message is still timely."
